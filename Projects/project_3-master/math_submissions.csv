What should I supplement my Khan Academy classes with?,1617045247,"Hello r/math,

I am an incoming Computer Science student and I am learning math from the start using Khan Academy.
Right now I am finishing the Pre Algebra, which I mostly just breezed through considering that I got the basics down already. But since I have seen people here saying that Khan Academy is not enough for a math heavy degree then I am wondering.. what should I supplement my Khan Academy classes with so that I can learn the material completely?

Right now I study for 5 hours a day and I only have 4 months left before I estimate college starts for me.
I am about to start Algebra Basics and my goal is to reach Basic Calculus aptitude in the span of 4 months.

I have a very large knowledge gap from Basic Algebra to Basic Calculus due to not taking Math seriously when I was in highschool, but now I am willing to work harder than ever before to reach my goal of becoming a competent programmer.

Do you guys have any tips so that I can reach that goal of mine and do it as effeciently as possible while making the most out of it? What should I supplement my Khan Academy classes with?

Any help will be much appreciated!

The ability to look at things in different, yet, constructed ways is the greatest joy I have ever acquired through my learning of maths. 

I’m not saying that one can’t achieve such by studying other subjects. But this is just my idea. For instance, last time when I was learning about a finance related test (which by itself is heavily related to math as you might guess), i was able to reconstruct most of the idea using my own graphical sense/understanding to help me to really get the idea without memorizing mouthful words. And I found myself extremely happy about the process of understanding some new things.

[Animation of \(x2\^a\) of the final equation below \(just so it looks nice, you know\) ](https://i.redd.it/q80sl09uuvp61.gif)

Last week  /u/Reubenwizard posted a function where `pi` unexpectedly appears in the limit.

The function:

A little cleaning, a little massaging (shifting the function by `x := x + 1` and applying the definition of factorial) gets it into this form:

&amp;#x200B;

Since we only care about this function in the limit, we can ignore the constant terms (and reduce) and end up with:

Many of you were right when mentioning it looked like a consequence of Stirling's approximation. The proof of Stirling's approximation is very digestible: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s\_approximation#An\_alternative\_derivation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation#An_alternative_derivation)

We can use a common form of the approximation as follows.

I'm sure to many of you, this is trivial- but seeing `pi` pop up in places I least expect it is always a joy (at least to me).

Booster pack problem (probability),1617028817,"Hello everyone,

I'm messing around with my own prototype card game and obviously, questions about probability arise from that. I'm not great at math, but I've figured out most questions I had. The following though, I can't solve. Does anyone know the answer to it?

There is a card set of 51 different cards. 14x 1 star, 12x 2 stars, 9x 3 stars, 8x 4 stars, 4x 5 stars and 4x 6 stars.
If you open a pack, you get 10 cards, with the following rarity rates:
Cards 1 - 4 are all 1 star
Cards 5 - 7 are all 2 stars
Cards 8 and 9 are 3 stars
Card 10 has an 80% chance to be a 4 star, a 15% chance to be a 5 star and a 5% chance to be a 6 star.

The question is: how many packs would on average need to be opened to get the full set of 51 cards?

I understand it can be simplified to just card 10, but I wanted to have the context here. So 1 in 20 packs is the average of pulling one 6 star, since it's a 5% chance right?

After that I get stuck. Simply saying 80 seems odd and does not account for duplicates. I discussed it with someone who said a rough estimate would be that since there's 4 6-stars, perhaps it's 4+80=320. But that's an estimate and not an average.

Definitions of the coefficients of a quadratic function.,1617002057,"So it's not much but for a while now I have been working on defining the coefficients of x in a quadratic equation as an extracurricular activity and just finalised the maths. Is my maths correct? (I am in Year 10 or a Freshman for my Americans out there)

So in most quadratic equations, the basic layout is ax^(2)\+bx+c. My goal is to define a, b and c in terms of the quadratic's peak and the y axis intersection. 

y axis intersection = i

Quadratic peak = {f, g}

So it is immediately obvious that c is equal to i. That is simple. However, a and b are much harder to work out. I got these. 

f=-b/2a

g=-(b/2a)^(2)\+i

c=i

After a long day of calculating I got this beauty.

In any quadratic curve mapped on a graph, the generating formula is as follows.

ax^(2)\+bx+c = -(g-i)/f^(2) \* x^(2) \+ 2(g-i)/f \* x + i.

Don't misunderstand me; I'm not looking to make a career out of mathematics. My intention is to think and act like a mathematician would, adopting the 'role' of a mathematician whenever I study the subject, instead of being a 'passive' student consuming regurgitated information.

An Outlier Result in a Card Game - How Improbable Was it?,1616954206,"I regularly play a card game called Quiddler: let’s say I’ve played 5,000 games, that seems a plausible number over the last fifteen years. It’s vaguely like Scrabble, in that you make words from letters worth various points, so spelling EAST would get you 10 points but JAZZ would get you 43. 

We figure if you score over 300 you’ve done well. That happens around 5-10% of the time. Most of those are under 310. For years our highest hand was 333, and second highest 325 - scoring over 320 is very rare, maybe ten-twenty games in total of the 5000?

But then recently we had a 367, which is just miles from any of the other results. That got me wondering  what the odds against such a result were, and it took me only a moment to realise I didn’t have the slightest idea how to work that out. 

Any ideas? There are other aspects to the scoring, like potential 10 point bonuses (two in each of the 8 hands of the game, but one is for most words and the other for longest word, so it’s usually pretty difficult to get both). It’s also got a big skill element to it, but pretty much all my games have been among the same small group of people, so that shouldn’t be a factor.",math,cyrano111,False,/r/math/comments/mf61q2/an_outlier_result_in_a_card_game_how_improbable/

Attempting a shift design proposal,1616893353,"Hello r/math!

This isn't so much 'homework' as real life - and real sleep. Currently, I'm on what is called 'swing shift', which gives me a 11 hour variance between shift start times every single week. It is very rough.

The hope is that someone, somewhere, can look at our current shift design and propose something that would:

1) Keep the start times as close to the same as possible;

2) Be between 40 and 44 hours a week (or 80 to 88 every two weeks and so on);

3) Possibly be designed around a one, two, or four week rotating design;

4) Gives each person at least 2 days off per week;

5) Keeps the supervisor (""A"") at the same start time!

Our shift days are strangely offset, in that they start at 2300 (11 PM) instead of 2400/0000 hours (12 midnight).

Ideally, I'd like to be able to show this to my manager/boss as an improvement on the current design.

how would you prove this,1616893151,"look at terms 2-5 of fibonacci sequence

multiply the first number by the third, and the second by the fourth, and sum those products, and the result is the 6th term (5)

move  down to terms 3-6 and do it again, and the result is the 8th term

do it again with terms 4-7 and you get the 10th term (34)

Now, instead of connecting the edges that way, you pull them out and away from the center before having them meet at the cylinder's midline. Now you have a blue torus with a yellow band along the outer circumference.

Finally, you form the torus by tucking the edges down into the cylinder and joining them at the midline. This time, you end up with a red torus with a yellow band along the inner circumference.

"Calculate area of plane in 3D space using X, Y, Z",1615979845,"0

I have a polygon that's positioned on the earth. For each point, I have:

The latitude in degrees (x) The longitude in degrees (y) The altitude above sea level in meters.

An example of one of my points is  { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }

Now, in my application, a user draws a polygon in space, and I need to determine the area of that polygon. The user could draw a polygon around a door, or a roof maybe. Sometimes even a sidewalk.

Once the user is done, I have a list of all the points they selected.

An example could be this:

    DOOR = [   { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }, // First point, bottom left   { x: 144.99533197184215, y: -32.39730172327194, z: 267.1472276731874 }, // Top left   { x: 144.99534689346532, y: -32.39726245542652, z: 267.04165748822226 }, // Top right   { x: 144.99534752390096, y: -32.39726407569114, z: 263.24884951333394 }, // Bottom right   { x: 144.99533074458003, y: -32.39730248504104, z: 263.24070871460185 }, // Last point, same as first to close the loop. ]; 

The issue now, is that I need to figure out the approximate area between all these points. I know that the polygon won't be perfectly flat, but I can even it out if needed to give an approximation.

**My current strategy is as follows:**

* Find the distance between each of the points using the [Haversine Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula#:%7E:text=The%20haversine%20formula%20determines%20the,and%20angles%20of%20spherical%20triangles.).
* Determine the height difference between the two points by subtracting z2  
 from z1  
.
* Find the actual length of the line using Pythagorus.
* Get the angle of the line relative to the horizontal plane using (Math.atan2(end.y - start.y, end.x - start.x) \* 180) / Math.PI  
 (Please excuse the Javascript, that's what I'm working in).
* I then have a list of all the lengths and the angles of each line.
* I then convert each angle to Radians.
* Then I generate x and y values like this:  
  endX = start.x + length \* Math.cos(angle)   endY = start.y + length \* Math.sin(angle) 
* This give me a list of the X.Y values of the points.
* I then calculate the area using [this formula](https://www.mathopenref.com/coordpolygonarea.html)

This strategy works when my plane is nearly horizontal, but as soon as I try use it on a vertical surface, I get incorrect results.

I guess there's a few questions here, and any help will be greatly appreciated.

Question about Infinity,1615962704,"Let's say there is an athelete who can jump about 1m average and he was able to make one 2m jump at some point. So let's say his possible jump height range is 1m~2m.
He gets lucky today, he was able to make another 2m jump. Jumped 1m, 1.2, 1.6, 2m. And he tries to do 2.1m jump and fails.
Let's have a look at that last try again. He was able to make 2m, but not 2.1m.
Here goes my question. If he couldnt make 2.1m jump, it indicates that at some point between 2 and 2.1m, there is a limit to him. And let's say the limit is 2.05m. If he is able to make 2.05m, wouldn't he be able to make 2.050000000...1m jump? It makes no sense that a person can't jump that tedny tiny gap more. Let's say he makes it. It gets repeated, and at some point he jumps 2.1m. But this doesn't make any sense since 1) I theoretically set the limit 2.05m.
2) if this gets repeated this way constantly, he us able to make unlimited jump.
But, it physically doesn't make any sense that a person can't jump 0.000000000...1m higher. If his limit was 2.05, then he is able to make 2.0499999999999999999...meter jump but not 2.05?

You should be able to jump that little higher, it would be really werid if he was unable to make the 2.000000000000...1m jump while he can do 2m jump.

If he is not able to make lets say 2.3meter jump, REAL MAX, then he was able to jump 2.99999999...meter jump but not 2.3 and it is very weird.

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Formula to calculate logarithmic curve in the context of IT-security,1615894292,"I'm actually a dev, but I think this question fits here as its about maths. I'm implementing a site wide throttle on too many failed requests as protection against distributed brute force attacks.

The question I am stuck with is, after how many failed login requests should I start to throttle?

Now one reasonable way is, as mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/477578/9013718) ""using a running average of your site's bad-login frequency as the basis for an upper limit"". If the site has an average of 100 failed logins, 300 (puffer added) might be a good threshold.

Now I don't have a running average and I don't want someone having to actively increase the upper limit as the user base grows. I want a dynamic formula that calculates this limit based on the active users amount.

The difficulty is that if there are only a few users, they should have a much higher user to threshold ratio than let's say 100k users. Meaning that for example for 50 users the limit could be set at 50% of the total user count which means allowing 25 failed login requests site-wide in a given timespan. But this ratio should decrease for 100k users, the threshold should be more like around 1%. 1000 failed login requests in the same let's say hour, is a lot (probably not accurate at all I am not a security expert, the numbers are only examples to illustrate).

I was wondering, is there any mathematical formula that could archive this in a neat way?

This is a chart of what I think the formula should be calculating approximately:

Question about Infinity,1615880468,"Hi and thanks in advance for your responses. 
Am I correct to believe that there are different levels of infinity?
For example, there are an infinite amount of numbers on the number line between 1 and 2 (1.01, 1.001, 1.0001, etc.) as well as an infinite amount of numbers between 2 and 3.
However, there is a mathematical difference between the infinity of 1 to 2 and 2 to 3.

Are there any symmetry rules for even and odd functions with periodic functions as arguments?,1615861195,"I'm trying to find a general set of rules for determining the harmonic content after some transformation. For example a sine wave (1 harmonic) passed into the absolute function f(x)=|x| will give a rectified sine (I'm only considering one cycle so we don't have to deal with divergence). A rectified sine is purely even harmonics. 

If we pass a square wave (odd harmonics) into the same function we get a constant DC offset (the 0th harmonic; a frequency of 0 AKA a vertical shift)

If we pass  saw wave (odd and even harmonics) in we get a triangle wave (odd harmonics)

If we pass a triangle wave (odd harmonics) we get another triangle wave at twice the frequency (odd harmonics)

If our transformation function is odd like tanh(x)

Passing in a sine wave (1 harmonic) gives new odd harmonics

passing in a square wave (odd harmonics) gives another square wave (odd harmonics)

passing in a saw (odd and even harmonics) adds odd harmonics

passing in a triangle (odd harmonics) adds odd harmonics

What I'm wondering is this: Is there a general rule based on the harmonic content of the original wave and the symmetry of the transformation function that tells you something about the harmonics of the outputted wave?

I'm also wondering how this applies to complex asymmetric waves and transformation functions 


*I've been racking my mind trying to find an answer to this and here's some thoughts that might be useful:* 

If a waveform is asymmetric or has a DC offset (a vertical shift), the bottom and top will transform differently and will add even and odd harmonics. Even waves (or waves than can be phase shifted INTO even functions), can potentially transform differently without a DC offset

In general, odd transformation curves will create odd harmonics when the waveforms you put in have an odd symmetry (or can be phase shifted to have odd symmetry)",math,LemonLimeNinja,False,/r/math/comments/m5ypyj/are_there_any_symmetry_rules_for_even_and_odd/

We continue with 222^(2) = 49284. The number 92 appears in between the 4 and the 8 of the 48 that appeared a step earlier. Each new double-digit number will be marked in between brackets:

So (at least in the US), many graduate schools have sent out or are starting to send out offers for Fall 2021 programs, and many prospective graduate students are starting to make their decisions about which graduate school to attend. However, lots of things have changed in response to COVID-19, including virtual visitation events.

---

We have many wonderful volunteers who are dedicating their time to answering your questions.  Their focuses span a wide variety of interesting topics, and we also have a few panelists that can speak to the graduate school process outside of the US.

We also have a handful of volunteers that are postdocs or have recently finished graduate school/postdocs and can speak to what happens after you earn your degree.  We also have some panelists who are now in industry/other non-math fields.

Furthermore, we also have panelists that have taken non-standard paths to math grad school, that are in grad school in related fields (such as computer science), or have taken unique opportunities in grad school!  

---

These panelists have special red flair.  However, if you're a graduate student or if you've received your graduate degree already, feel free to chime in and answer questions as well!  The more perspectives we have, the better!

Again, the panel will be running over the course of the next two weeks, so feel free to continue checking in and asking questions!

Furthermore, one of our former panelists, /u/Darth_Algebra has kindly contributed [this excellent presentation about applying to graduate schools and applying for funding](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1niqlzySV4JZGFFbzVjV1RaOEE/edit?usp=sharing).

Independent math research for high schoolers,1615785821,"Hi! I'm a high school student who is applying to some math programs, but many of them ask me to tell them about prior research projects I've done.

However, I don't need to have a paper or anything and I just need to describe what I did, so could someone please suggest some impressive-sounding projects that I can talk about without actually doing?

Quotient rings,1615780025,"We know that R\[x\]/(x\^2+1) is isomorphic to C (complex numbers) and from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, we know that any real polynomial of degree n has exactly n roots in C.

I was wondering how ""quotienting"" R\[x\] with x\^2 + 1 gives a field that contains the roots of all the polynomials in R\[x\]. Does quotienting R\[x\] with any other irreducible polynomial, say x\^4+1, give the same field?

Are there symmetry rules for odd and even functions with respect to the arguments?,1615775129,"I know odd functions are f(x)=-f(-x) and even functions are f(x)=f(-x) leading to the symmetry that multiplying odd functions give an even function and multiplying even functions give an even function, and multiplying an odd and even function gives an odd function.

What I'm wondering about is if there are any symmetry rules for odd/even functions as arguments of other odd/even functions.

For example f(x)=sin(x), and g(x)=arctan(x) are both odd functions. but g(f(x))=arctan(sin(x)) is also an odd function. If we use the even function h(x)=|x|, g(h(x))=arctan(|x|) which is an even function

so odd function as an argument of an odd function is an odd function

even function as an argument of an odd function is an even function

If I look at the other two cases using the same functions above just use |arctan(x)| instead I get:

odd function as an argument of an even function is an even function

even function as an argument of an even function is an even function

does this generalize to any odd and even function. Is there any class of asymmetric functions that when passed into an odd/even function will give another odd or even function",math,LemonLimeNinja,False,/r/math/comments/m5akq3/are_there_symmetry_rules_for_odd_and_even/

Caluclus Notation,1615758037,"The notation used for derivatives that is typically taught is either (usually both):

    f(x) = sin(x)
    
    df/dx = cos(x)
      or
    f'(x) = cos(x)

With the df/dx notation often being considered a bit more illuminating.

When you get to real analysis you'll (happily) be able to define derivatives without division without using (evil) division""

    The derivative of f at x is some scalar c such that
    
    lim h -&gt; 0 of  f(x + h) = f(x) + c h = 0

In fact this definition most naturally suggests an alternative notation for Calculus:

    df = cos(x) dx

I claim this notation is pragmatically *better* than the alternatives in a number of ways.

First, note that this notation is actually already taught in Calculus, but exclusively for used in integration.  We write an integration problem as ""y = ∫ cos(x) dx"".  If we really want notation that supports the notation that an integral is the inverse of a derivative, then the most natural way to express the derivative of ""sin(x)"" is as ""cos(x) dx"" since this is exactly what we pass into the integral function.

Second, Calculus with several variables becomes more natural.  What is the gradient of x \* y?  Currently your Calculus student will ask you what you want the derivative with respect to because the notation they've learned doesn't naturally generalize to anything but a single variable.  The answer should be easy: ""y dx + x dy"".  Taking derivatives with respect to a particular variable should be seen as a special case (i.e. equivalent to setting dy=0 in the example above).  Instead we *only* teach derivatives with respect to a single variable in Calculus 1-3.  People take 3 Calculus courses without learning what the [Del operator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del) is.

Third, Calculus can be applied to matrices, and the standard notation of ""df/dx"" makes no sense in this context.  For instance, if ""C = A B"" then we can write ""dC = A dB + dA B"" (source: [the best pdf on the Internet](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf)).

Note that if we write this as ""dC/dB = A"" there is the natural question of *what dC/dB even refers to*.  You're... multiplying dC by the inverse of dB (which need not be square!) and that equals some third matrix?!  Yes, we both know ""dy/dx"" isn't ""really"" a fraction, but then maybe our notation should actually reflect that!  Writing ""dC = A dB + dA B"" makes this immediately clear: dB represents a small change in B and if we want to know what the corresponding small change in C is we can simply multiply dB by A.

Fourth, this approach is more natural for differential equations.

* ""y += cos(x) \* dx"" is literally the line of code you write for Euler's method (also works for more than 1 dimensions)
* The definition for ""linear separable equation"" goes from ""N(y) dy/dx = M(x)"" to the much more elegant ""N(y) dy = M(x) dx"".  It's instructive to look at the venerable Paul Dawkin's [notes](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/DE/Separable.aspx), where he has to jump through some hoops to take his reader from the bad definition to the good one.  Note also that the first thing he does is integrate with respect to x, which involves magically adding a ""dx"" to both sides of the equation to make it integral-friendly .  This incantation can be omitted if one could simply start with the natural definition for ""separable"".

In short: the notation used for matrix calculus is intuitive, flows naturally from (one) definition of the derivative, is currently already used when teaching integration.  It should become the de facto notation.",math,you-get-an-upvote,False,/r/math/comments/m54zog/caluclus_notation/

What is the geometric interpretation of dy/dx for the folium of Descartes?,1615753247,"So I was working through some problem sets from Pollard and Tenenbaum's text on ODEs and ran into an interesting problem. It was the only problem that I scratched my head over, and oddly enough, it was the only problem where the answer wasn't given. The problem is stated as follows:

If x^(3) \+ y^(3) \-3xy = 0,

then... (by implicit differentiation)

3x^(2) \+ 3y^(2) (dy/dx) - 3x(dy/dx) - 3y = 0

therefore...

dy/dx = (y - x^(2) )/(y^(2) \- x),     For  y^(2)  **≠**  x

Explain by the use of its graph what this means geometrically.

Near the end somewhere the presenter just throws in that a small modification to his sequence of sequences can be used to generate primes.

I created the Rosetta Code task, and [Python entry](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Partition_function_P#Python:_Mathloger) that follows the video, going so far as to add the prime number generator too.

Another mental todo item was that I remembered from this, or probably another mathologer video where he pointed out that two sequences can lull you into thinking they are the same for several values before they then diverge. I needed to check the partition based prime generator against a sieve.

Is there a terminology/research available for something i can best describe as boolean space entropy?

Number of regions created by all pairwise bisecting hyperplanes between n points,1615634067,"Let {Pi} be n distinct points in a d-dimensional Euclidean space. For every pair (Pi,Pj) with i≠j, we can construct a perpendicular bisecting hyperplane equidistant between the two points, which splits the space into two regions. We can construct n(n−1)/2 such cuts, splitting the region into N pieces.

**Question**: What is the maximum number of regions N(d,n) that can be produced in this way?

This is a similar but more restricted version of the lazy caterer/cake number problem (generalized to higher dimensions), because the pairwise, equidistant perpendicular bisector constraint prevents certain cuts from existing.

* If d=1, we actually do get the lazy caterer's sequence: with n(n−1)/2 cuts we can construct N(1,n)=n(n−1)/2+1 regions.

* If d=2, we have N(2,1)=1 and N(2,2)=2 trivially. For n=3, the three points form a triangle, and by construction the cuts always meet at the triangle's orthocenter, so we get N(2,3)=6, and not 7 regions as in the lazy caterer sequence. This is an example of how this problem differs from most questions I keep finding along these lines. I am almost sure N(2,4)=18 and N(2,5)=46, but I couldn't prove it.

* In general, if I didn't mess it up, it seems N(d,d+1)=(d+1)!, because one can always construct a simplex to generalize the orthocenter idea.

I've been working on this on and off for a few weeks now, but I'm haven't come up with a good argument for the general case. Any pointers? I would have figured this sort of problem would have been solved somewhere at this point, but I my search hasn't come up with anything.

The 2nd book in probability,1615630996,"What is a good second book in probability?

I have taken an introductory course in probability where I worked quite intensively with Jim Pitmans ""Probability"".

I am going to take a course in Stochastic processes in the fall, and I would like to supplement with another book than the course book (which is ""An Introduction to Stochastic Modelling"" by Pinsky and Karlin).

At the moment, I am doing a reading course in Axler's Measure, Integration &amp; Real Analysis, so I should have some measure theory down by now.

I am going to be selfstudying and using Anki to help internalize definitions and theorems and book structure, so I am looking for something clean, rigorous and well-structured.

What I don't really know is whether I should look for some kind of general 2nd ""the real deal"" introduction to Probability, or if I should look for some kind of Stochastic Processes book, or maybe some kind of mix. I just don't know what is an appropriate follow up from Pitman's Probability.

The topics covered in the fall course are going to be:

Markov Chains: Introduction
Markov Chains: Random walk, First Step Analysis, Random sums, Branching Processes
Markov Chains: Limiting and invariant distributions, classification of states and chains
Poisson Processes
Birth and Death Processes
Finite State Continuous Time Markov Chains, Queueing systems; basic and intermediate queueing theory

A little relationship I noticed between graphs and binary operations,1615563218,"Take G, a directed graph, and a function G -&gt; M labeling each vertex with an element of some magma M (a binary operation on a set).

Suppose a vertex labeled A has an edge to a vertex labeled B. Then you are allowed to merge these vertices together into one, with label AB (that is, the product of A times B in the magma M).

Say that M ""fits"" G if any two sequences of merges which lead to the entire graph becoming a single vertex put the same label on that vertex, and if this is also true for any subset of the graph. Say that M ""perfectly fits"" G if it fits G regardless of the labels initially placed on G's vertices. Then it's possible to describe certain important properties of M by the kinds of graphs it fits.

M is commutative, for instance, if and only if it perfectly fits the undirected 2-chain. It's associative if and only if it perfectly fits the directed 3-chain - and both commutative AND associative if it perfectly fits the undirected triangle graph. It's unital if there is a specific element 0 such that, for any graph it fits, you can add a vertex labeled 0 with an undirected edge to any vertex of the graph, and it also fits the result.

"Borger’s Absolute Geometry, Anyone?",1615539402,"A frustrating aspect of scheme theory is that the final object of Sch, Spec Z, has “too much internal structure.” Often (in arithmetic geometry) we work over a base Spec F_p instead (a finite field), which internally is just a point with the obvious function field. There’s a famous analogy between number theory and arithmetic curves—more precisely, between number fields and function fields on arithmetic curves over Spec F_p (complex curves are also part of this “rosetta stone” but we won’t need that here). There’s an analogy of the Riemann hypothesis for arithmetic curves, which of course is much easier to prove. Weil proved this in the 1950s if I’m not mistaken, and then Grothendieck’s etale cohomology and some ingenious work by Deligne extended this to nonsingular projective varieties over finite fields.

For a long time geometers have dreamed about doing geometry over a “deeper base” than Spec Z, namely the hypothetical “field with one element” F1. The idea is that Spec Z would be a kind of arithmetic curve over F1, and number fields would be realized as the function fields of curves over F1. In particular, if the fiber product of Spec Z with itself over Spec F1 made sense and was amenable to some kind of intersection theory, we might imitate Weil and prove the Riemann hypothesis. Of course there is no “field with one element” as such, so this thing would have to lie outside the world of rings/schemes.

Ten years ago or so Borger [developed](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.3146.pdf) an approach for thinking about geometry over F1. He interprets the structure of a lambda-ring on a ring R, an endomorphism lifting the Frobenius on R mod p for each p, as descent data for Spec R -&gt; Spec Z to Spec F_1. This induces a geometric morphism of topoi between the gros etale topos of schemes (over Spec Z) and the “gros etale topos over Spec F_1,” which is defined thereby. So this isn’t just a way to look at schemes over F_1, but also all etale sheaves. 

I’m curious, for those who work in this area, what progress has been made in developing Borger’s absolute geometry. Is it promising? How does it compare to other approaches to F1 geometry, like “blue schemes” or multiplicative monoids?

I suppose you could say that Scholze-Fargues’ recent work is very roughly related to this general idea, in that the goal is to describe a problem about number fields (local Langlands) in terms of geometry over a new curve (the “Fargues-Fontaine curve.”)",math,whisperfiends,False,/r/math/comments/m3dou6/borgers_absolute_geometry_anyone/

Using a nuclear bomb to fry an egg,1615516768,"Here is a fun proof I ran across recently of the cube root of 2 being irrational:

Let \[;a,b \\in \\mathbb{Z};\] with \[;\\frac{b}{a};\] reduced, then assume 

\[;2\^{1/3} = \\frac{b}{a};\]

\[;2\^{1/3}a=b;\]

\[;2a\^3=b\^2;\]

\[;a\^3+a\^3=b\^3;\]

which, by Fermat's Last Theorem, is a contradiction since there are no integer solutions! You could make the same argument for \[;2\^{1/n};\] for \[;n&gt;2;\].

How to not forget random things during a test,1615510222,"So my score is already being reduced by my teacher because she thinks I’m cheating but as long as I write slow and my work is clear she won’t do anything. The problem with writing slow is that I have to rush the actual questions since I spend time writing more than thinking of the next question, so that leads to me forgetting things like domain and range. Yes I did study before the test since she gave us the worksheet pages the question where based on but I still somehow mixed up domain and range on the test. Any tips or tricks to not forget stuff immediately? I have a good physics grade so it’s not a problem with my actual solving of problems but the language trips me up along with figuring out how to write it on delta math. All the tips online are kinda weird and more to do with preparing better but I’m remember after the test when thinking about the actual test so I don’t think they apply too well to me.

Algebraic geometry is kicking my ass,1615507037,"I had an assignment due today and I'm pretty sure I got close to a 0 on it.

I've been doing okay in the class so far. It's a crosslisted graduate introduction to algebraic geometry. The first half of the class was pretty basic stuff: review of commutative algebra, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz, Zariski topology, algebraic sets, regular functions, etc.

All good so far. 

Then we started getting into sheaves, and functors of points, and group schemes, and next thing I know, we have 17 different equivalent definitions of an affine algebraic variety which aren't even vaguely close to the one we started with, and all these equivalences of categories which simply don't make sense. I was kind of able to follow along up until group schemes, where he completely lost me.


I've attended the lectures and watched the recordings over, tried to decipher the lecture notes, but it's literally like Chinese to me. I have to spend hours and hours just to understand a single paragraph.

I have the proper prerequisites, so I don't know what the problem is. In fact, I have more of a background than what's being asked - the only formal prereq is a 3rd year course in abstract algebra, and he said he would cater the content to students with this background - yeah right!

I went to community college for 2 years, got my AA and transferred to a 4 year last year. I’m working towards my Mathematics BS. Transitioning to a 4 year was already hard enough considering community college is pretty much just high school 2.0. The work load is incomparable. On top of that, I was only at my university for 2 quarters since Covid kicked us out of school. Online classes have been extremely tough for me. It is not the ideal scenario for learning math in my opinion. I’m taking elementary number theory, numerical computation and a filler econ class but I have completely screwed this quarter up. I don’t think I’m going to pass any of them. I’m teetering with one, failed one completely, and I have to get 100% on the final if I want a 70% in the last one. I feel extremely burnt out with math and it disgust me to even look at it. These proof classes are insane and just a completely different way of thinking.

Trouble following university lectures,1615487878," So I’m currently in undergrad and ever since arriving at college, I’ve had a very difficult time following along with (most) lectures in math classes. My first semester when I took multivariable calculus, I got off to a rocky start. I did rather poorly in the class until I started skipping all of the main lectures and learning the material instead through MIT OCW and the textbook. It might be fine if it were just that one class. However, I had a similar experience in other math classes. I’ve only had a couple of math professors for whom I’ve been able to learn effectively from their lectures. I was wondering if anyone could relate or provide me with some insight, because it's kinda discouraging. I know people say that you should read the textbook ahead of the actual lecture so that you can follow along, but if I can just read the book to learn the material ahead of time, what’s the point of attending the lecture at all? And don’t say to ask the professor questions. In my experience, the kinds of questions people ask the lecturer are mostly clarification questions. In other words, they eventually would have been able to answer it on their own. If you truly have a question about the material that’s worth asking the professor, I feel like it’s probably a question that would be more appropriate for something like office hours rather than the main lecture.  I have considered the possibility that I'm just not particularly good at math (I typically don't have this problem with CS, which is easier than math). However, it's also the case that I still tend to do fairly well in math classes provided that I find resources that I'm able to learn effectively from (mostly videos online and/or the textbook).

Looking To Pair With A New Mathematician To Draft Type-Set Course Notes,1615482493," 

I think that it's pretty common knowledge that new professors have a lot of stress managing research and their course preparations. So I was thinking there's an opportunity for a mutual partnership in this regard.

I am entering my PhD in September and I wanted to try and develop a bit of money on the side, so I thought what I could do is provide a service for 1-2 mathematicians who would like a rough draft of written course notes to be typeset in LaTeX, but more specifically, in Overleaf. The reason I am particular about mathematicians is that my area of study is heavily mathematical (optimization, differential equations, mathematical ecology) so if I can find someone who needs to teach in this area, there's an added benefit in that I can get some exposure to some of the concepts and material while I work on type-setting the notes over the summer in preparation for September. Additionally, since most of the heavy lifting will be done for you in terms of type-setting, you can then just modify the code (which would be yours) however you like.

In any case, for those who are interested please feel free to shoot me a dm and we can explore this together and figure something out!",math,FondleMyFirn,False,/r/math/comments/m2v59b/looking_to_pair_with_a_new_mathematician_to_draft/

"Anyone else just suddenly had math just ""click"" with them?",1615446514,"I remember as a kid in elementary school I used to be horrible at math, for one reason or another I just was absolutely horrible. Around the age 7 I would say, I would get a huge interest in physics and I wanted to be an astrophysicist, without even knowing what it was called, so already as a kid I was already very passionate about being a ""space scientist"" as I called it. I was so bad at math that I would oftentimes cry during math tests because I was the last one trying to finish a math test. I remember I would instead just watch documentaries about astronomy and space and a lot of the math they brought up, like parallax, and Newton's laws of motion made so much more sense to me.

Formula to find the numbers on a row of Pascal's triangle?,1615413196,"Hello everyone,

Fun examples of non-measurable sets,1615397386,"When one first learns about the existence of non-measurable subsets of the reals, I think one often gets the impression that this can only be done via the arcane Vitali set construction, taking a Hamel basis of R/Q and so on. Obviously you do need something beyond just basic ZF, and there certainly is no constructive way to do it, but it doesn't have to be quite so intangible. So please post your favourite way result about non-measurable sets that make them less intangible in this thread.

Here's a fun example I learned about earlier today:

Consider, as usual, the set [0,1). Take some irrational number theta. We can define a graph structure on [0,1) by saying that there is an edge from a to b if a-b=theta mod 1. It's easy to see that this means every number has exactly two neighbours: x has neighbours x-theta and x+theta mod 1. 

The fact that theta is irrational tells us that this graph is also acyclic -- because if it were cyclic then we'd have x +  n\*theta = x mod 1 for some integer n and some x, but this implies n\*theta would be an integer, which is impossible. Thus obviously we can two-colour the graph.

Now consider the set of points we coloured red. This set will not be measurable! (I didn't catch a citation for this result -- hopefully one of the logic/set theory people around here recognise it and can help out.)

Now, there's one thing remaining: Clearly I must have used some type of choice here to construct this set, since it is non-measurable, but it is perhaps not immediately obvious if you aren't used to this kind of idea. Where did I use it?

&gt;!I said this was *obviously* two-colourable, since it is acyclic. But how do you actually construct this two-colouring? It's pretty easy to get started -- for any finite subset of the interval [0,1), I can colour it no problem. If my subset contains some chain of adjacent vertices, it's just a finite path which I definitely know how to two-colour, and isolated vertices are even easier. But how to get from this to colouring the entire interval?!&lt;

&gt;!Say the magic words ""compactness theorem"". We can colour any finite subset with two colours, therefore the entire graph is two-colourable. The compactness theorem is equivalent to the Boolean prime ideal theorem, so that's our use of choice.!&lt;

&gt;!What I particularly liked about this is that it was mentioned in a talk about applications of the Lovász local lemma in various areas. Somehow the local lemma and the compactness theorem seem spiritually similar to me -- both take a statement that we can do something locally and say we can then do it globally, sort of. I wonder if there's a less spiritual connection between them...!&lt;",math,GLukacs_ClassWars,False,/r/math/comments/m231gl/fun_examples_of_nonmeasurable_sets/

Iterative algorithm for finding closest orthonormal matrix,1615384459,"Hey guys!

I stumbled across an iterative algorithm in the open-source library [Apache Commons Math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/) and I was wondering if anyone knows the origin of the following algorithm:

Lets denote the [special orthogonal group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_rotation_group) of dimension 3 with `SO(3)`.Let `M` be a real 3x3 matrix which is 'almost' in `SO(3)`. Now, the algorithm claims to find an `X` out of `SO(3)` such that `||X - M||_2` is sufficiently small. It goes like this

    Xn+1 = Xn - 0.5 * (Xn.Mt.Xn - M)

where `X_0 = M` and `Mt` denotes the transposed `M`. The loop terminates if

1. The subsequent difference between the 'corrections' are sufficiently small `| ||Xn+1-M|| - ||Xn-M|| | &lt; eps` or
2. The maximum number of iteration is exceeded.

Does anyone know where I can find the origin of this algorithm? Or maybe a reference to a paper or something? I have been looking for the last several hours and so far I suspect it is a light-weight, iterative algorithm to solve the [Orthogonal Procrustes problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_Procrustes_problem). Possibly applying several assumptions on the Matrix `M` (e.g. 'almost' orthogonal so `M^-1 = M^T`) and combining and truncating the iterative numeric algorithms for square root, inverse and singular value decomposition to end up with this short algorithm.

Thank you guys! :)

Creating a learning curve,1615382186,"Hello Internet! First of all i should admit im an idiot.. i never went to college or really got past calculus. I need help. Long story short im a trainer for a large logistics driven company and I was handed a project and one of the large elements of this project is developing a ""learning curve"" to be applied to a training program I created. The training program is for forklift operation. I'm so fucking lost. I Googled learning curve and got a bunch of algebraic equations that im far too stupid to understand. Does anyone out there have any insight as to where to start. I kept reading about an 80% compliance level? Im sorry if this is too vague or I sound like an idiot im trying to understand this&gt;

Wright's Model, the learning curve function is defined as follows:

Y = aXb

where:
Y = the cumulative average time (or cost) per unit.
X = the cumulative number of units produced.
a = time (or cost) required to produce the first unit.
b = slope of the function when plotted on log-log paper.
   = log of the learning rate/log of 2.

 ￼

For an 80% learning curve b = log .8/log 2 = -.09691/.301 = -.32196

If the first unit required 100 hours, the equation would be:

Y = 100X-.322

The equation for cumulative total hours (or cost) is found by multiplying both sides of the cumulative average equation by X.

Since X times Xb = X1+b, the equation is:

XY = aX1+b

Thus, the equation for cumulative total labor hours is,

XY = 100X1-.322 = 100X.678

An 80 percent learning curve means that the cumulative average time (and cost) will decrease by 20 percent each time output doubles. In other words, the new cumulative average for the doubled quantity will be 80% of the previous cumulative average before output is doubled. For example, assume that direct labor cost $20 per hour in the problem above. The cumulative average hours and cost as well as cumulative total hours and cost are provided below for doubled quantities 1 through 8.",math,tcgarraty,False,/r/math/comments/m1x8ld/creating_a_learning_curve/

Concerned about mathematics with aphantasia,1615347210,"I experience this ""thing"" called aphantasia (not technically a diagnosable condition so I don't know what to call it other than ""thing"").

Quick summary for those who don't know:

""Aphantasia"" is being unable to visualize things in your mind. You can have memories and think about things, but you don't see anything in your head.

One reason that most people don't know abut this and why there is so little research on it, is because it's very easy to have it and not even know. Some people have lived most of their lives with aphantasia without ever suspecting a thing.

I'm an undergrad math major and want to eventually go to grad school. I'm worried about this aphantasia thing though, because there is almost no academic work on this. I have no way of knowing if it will affect me. But it worries me because of what I've noticed when learning math. I always have a really hard time learning from visuals. I can *follow* the stuff like ""integration is the area under a curve"" and ""vectors are lines"", and I can sort of understand what's going on in 3blue1brown videos or whatever. But it gives me the same feeling I get when my statistics professor tells me to ""just memorize"" stuff. I didn't understand the idea of a limit *at all* in Calculus I. The first time limits ""clicked"" for me and I could start to understand it was when someone *finally* showed me the epsilon-delta stuff. I just started linear algebra, and my professor in that class introduces stuff like vectors with arrows and parallelogram addition, but the stuff I've actually felt like I understood is when he switches back to the ""definition"" stuff and explains *that* part.

So I keep getting more anxious about this when I hear so many famous quotes in math about how important visualizing math is, and how you lose all the insight without pictures or whatever. I'm especially worried about later stuff that involves higher dimensional geometry (I think topology is one?) since it seems like you need to have a really good mind's eye to handle thinking about that stuff. It's always really hard for me to understand math visually. Even in geometry, I feel like I have to spend a long time thinking about the proofs before I understand the pictures, even though the it's the pictures that are supposed to help explain the proofs.

I'm sorry this post was so long. Basically I just want to know if anyone has any perspective or advice that might help me out.",math,minimizetetration,False,/r/math/comments/m1octu/concerned_about_mathematics_with_aphantasia/

My guidance counselor recommended that I take AP Calculus BC which I don't think is necessary but maybe I am wrong. However, I am more interested in taking either AP Statistics or Differential Calculus. I want to become a Computer Science major so I am not sure which is better choice for college applications.

"Discussing Living Proof: Anxiety Attacked Me, But I Survived, by Ken Millett",1615309217,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

This week's essay starts on *page 126* and is titled

12th grader here/ Math Finals (national matriculation exam) in 63 days and I lack concepts I should have learned in middle school,1615301122,"tl;dr I always hear that from my private tutors that my base is not strong at all. My dad did use to teach me but at the end of 7th grade he had to go away for his job and I somehow passed my 7th-grade finals thanks to my sister. I had my pre-board exams yesterday and I cried. I need help.

Long version- I cried because:

1) I knew I didn't practise as I should have.

2) I didn't pay a ton of attention during my online classes by my tutor(but he is a good guy and I do understand some concepts. Like I understand it completely when he teaches me but when it comes to opening my book and solving the sums in the exercises, I can't do it)

3) I know no one inherently hates maths but I seriously detest it. I believe my childhood has to be blamed for it.

4) Khan academy IS useful but some basic things confuse me like: I understand derivated of e\^x but when it comes to the [derivative of a\^x](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHzLHknEk1M)..... why are we raising exponents in the first place?? What is a natural log? I thought there were just logs of this and this? BUt now it seems there's natural or unnatural as well?/

5) Prof Leonard's videos seem helpful but I've just not had the time to sit down and watch and understand them but I will from this week onwards.

6) Calculus is very hard???? I want to pursue econ after high school but with the marks I get in simple mathematics, I don't think I'll be able to compete with my peers.

7) I have continuously failed maths since 8th grade. Started from getting 25/100 then 9th grade around 15 or 16/100 finally during my 10th national board exam I somehow passed. I got 53 out of 100 out of which I believe 18 to 20 i.e. the full marks from the project and the rest i.e. *barely* passing again from the actual exam and it actually went well for me. Like I was goddamn prepared for it throughout the year. In the 11th final, I got 7 out of 100 ( the full paper is on 100 marks). In online tests, I cheated but still practised. I've had private tutors since 8th grade FYI if that helps so I am *dumb dumb.*

I am willing to put effort here. I at least wanna aim for a B. I wanna drop my [syllabus](https://cisce.org/UploadedFiles/PDF/6.%20MATHEMATICS.pdf) here so I could get the help I need ( also, not a huge fan of trigonometry so any sum related to trigonometry is out of my reach. Also, I may be able to solve some sums but when there are multiple sums in the question paper with the integration signs, I get confused as to which chapter is it from because I'm so used to solving sums chapter wise from the book so my brain goes- is it asking for a substitution or by parts or is it something else?)",math,Hozierisking,False,/r/math/comments/m17ube/12th_grader_here_math_finals_national/

The game is a roulette wheel, where given the fact that you choose the number the wheel lands on, your bet will be multiplied by the number the roulette wheel lands on + the original bet.

For example, 1 will double your currency, 3 would give you 3x your currency than the original 1x (4x).

Announcement: /r/math's 14th Graduate School Panel's Call for Volunteers,1615228185,"Greetings, /r/math,

So (at least in the US), many graduate schools have sent out or are starting to send out offers for Fall 2021 programs, and many prospective graduate students are starting to make their decisions about which graduate school to attend. However, lots of things have changed in response to COVID-19, including virtual visitation events.

So it's important for us to hold the 14th **/r/math Graduate School Panel** for 2 weeks starting **Monday, March 15th, 2021**.  In this panel, we'll welcome any and all questions about going to graduate school and the application process.  We'll also put together a bunch of helpful resources regarding graduate school.  Furthermore, if you're interested in attending specific universities, I also recommend asking the department to put you in touch with current graduate students so you can get an idea of the climate of the department.

**Here is a link to the** [**first**](http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/21u1ix/rmath_graduate_school_panel/)**,** [**second**](http://redd.it/2kh7et)**,** [**third**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/30t9gn/rmaths_third_graduate_school_panel/)**,** [**fourth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/49egld/rmaths_fourth_graduate_school_panel/), [**fifth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/5e5d91/rmaths_fifth_graduate_school_panel/), [**sixth**](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/60hbdz/rmaths_sixth_graduate_school_panel/), [**seventh**](https://redd.it/75ajb7), [**eighth**](https://redd.it/8276ho), [**ninth**](https://redd.it/9oeen0), [**tenth**](https://redd.it/azv7ac), [**eleventh**](https://redd.it/dl2ms2), [**twelfth**](https://redd.it/fks01d), and [**13th**](https://redd.it/j9tkpg) Graduate School Panels, to get an idea of what this will be like.

---

To make this work, **we need a lot of volunteers** to help us answer all of these questions over the course of the panel.  In addition to current math graduate students (US or otherwise), we welcome perspectives from graduate students in related fields, postdocs, professors, graduates in industry, etc.

Ideally, you'll be available on Monday to answer questions, but feel free to pop in over the next 2 weeks to help answer any later questions!

As a small reward for helping out, we'll give out special colored flair, which will also help distinguish the panelists.  If you're interested in helping out, comment here or send us a message [via modmail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmath), and maybe say a bit about what you're currently studying!

Is the application of continued fractions to approximation theory still a relevant topic?,1614864911,"I have been reading a book called “The Application of Continued Fractions and Their Generalizations to Problems in Approximation Theory” by Alexey Khovanskii, published in 1963. This book is one of the craziest things I have ever read; I imagine it is what the average person thinks math looks like if you keep going past high school. There are just pages upon pages of formula derivations, with up to 10 or more variables using both Greek and Latin letters. There are special cases, setting some of those variables equal to 0 or 1, or to each other. On top of all that, there are precious few words describing what is going on, or why the author does what he does. Certainly, some of this my fault because, for example, differential equations aren’t my thing and I had to look up the Riccati equation on Wikipedia. 

With all that being said, I can’t look away from this book. I’m thinking of going through with pen and paper and working through all of the derivations. The key, though, is that I’ll have a computer at my side. The book presents 8 different ways to approximate sqrt(2). The approximations have differing levels of precision because they converge slowly and at different rates, and the author only shows six or so iterations for each, presumably because computer time was so dear and doing the calculations by hand would be arduous. 

I assume approximation theory is still quite relevant in today’s world, and I’m sure algorithms have been studied and optimized significantly over the last 60 years. Is anyone out there familiar with this application of continued fractions? Is any of this still relevant? I wouldn’t be surprised to find out that the topic has been completely studied and described, and then superseded by some other type of algorithm. Heck, for all I know, continued fractions themselves are considered passé.",math,MathEnjoyer,False,/r/math/comments/lxkm36/is_the_application_of_continued_fractions_to/

Stochastic Calculus: Equivalence between diffusion and persistence ?,1614853189," 

UPDATE: Found my solution thanks a rabbit hole induced by a comment in a different subreddit. See explanation at the bottom.

Original definitions how I understand them:

Purely diffusive process: Gaussian process whose variance is linear in time.

Super diffusive: variance's grows with time faster than linear.

Sub-diffusive: variance's grows with time slower than linear.

Persistent process: if during some interval, the value increased, then in the next interval of equal duration - it is more likely to increase again (continue the trend) than it is to decrease.

Anti-persistence: If during some interval the value increased, it is more likely to mean revert (decrease) in the next interval of equal duration.

Hurst Coefficient: tells us which one of these a process follows (&gt;0.5 for persistence, &lt;0.5 for anti-persistence, 0.5 for purely diffusive)

My problem:

I'm seeing many references super-diffusion and persistence being equivalent, and similarly for sub-diffusion and anti persistence. Why is this the case ?

Additionally, the threshold value of Hurst exponent (H=0.5) is said to imply pure diffusion (linear variance). I understand if the variance is linear, then the STDEV should grow with the square root of time, but why does H describe the growth of the STDEV ? Looking at its calculation, the E\[R(n)/S(n)\] is very much NOT the standard deviation.. SO:

\- Why does a Hurst coefficient the way it is calculated in Rescaled Range Analysis of 1/2 indicate linear variance ?

\- Why does the Hurst coefficient &gt;0.5 or &lt;0,5 guarantee persistence or anti persistence as defined above ?

\- Why does super diffusion imply persistence, and why does sub-diffusion imply anti-persistence ?

My intuition - I realise that a variance that grows slowly in time can be associated with mean reversion, because the smaller the variance the higher the likelihood for smaller deviation from the mean. However, the two terms seem to be used interchangeably, as if they are strictly the same thing. I can't find a proof or even an explanation for this anywhere, been searching a long time.. any help or resource would be appreciated !

Solution:

Rescaled Range Analysis does not define H, rather, it is defined as a characterising parameter of the Fractional Brownian Process, a generalisation of Brownian motion, which is also Gaussian with 0 mean, but allows some correlation. it was first defined by Mandelbrot Van-Ness as some integral there is no reason to get into here, but basically H defines its autocorrelation as such: E\[X\_t\*X\_s\]=1/2\*(t\^2H + s\^2H-|t-s|\^2H). If we look at to consecutive increments (w.l.o.g assume t&lt;s) then their correlation is E\[X\_t(X\_s-X\_t)\]=E\[X\_t\*X\_s\]-E\[X\_t\^2\]. NOW if you play around with the expression for the correlation, you will find that this correlation is &gt;0 (or, E\[X\_t\*X\_s\]&gt;E\[X\_t\^2\]) iff H&gt;0.5, vice versa for H&lt;0.5, AND it is zero for 0.5. This explains why H describes correlation between increments. Rescaled Range Analysis is simply a powerful tool to estimate H. Another way is to look at the asymptotic behaviour of the empirical variance (which is essentially an autocorrelation between s=t). Because this expression, in particular, describes the variance's dependence on time, this ties in the definitions of diffusion explained above - completely equivalent. This makes me happy.",math,Success-Dangerous,False,/r/math/comments/lxhga4/stochastic_calculus_equivalence_between_diffusion/
Enclosing a circle using three (four or five) triangles with smallest area?,1614852035,"In real-time computer graphics, rendering small circles/circular particles is commonly achieved by drawing two triangles that form a square:

https://preview.redd.it/36imjvsiczk61.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8bc883f0c950b735971cee83e9106c9643c997db

The 'excess' parts of these two triangles outside the circle area will be programmed to draw a transparent color, resulting in a circular final output shape. However, this excess still generates wasted processing, since the computer's graphics card still needs to check through those pixels even though they will end up being transparent.

This wasted area is 4/pi \~= 1.273 \~ 27.3%. (ratio of area of smallest enclosing square to a unit circle)

Historically, in the early days of dedicated graphics cards, a single equilateral triangle would sometimes be used to overlap a circular particle, since a single triangle has one few unique vertex (three vs four for two triangles):

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/byuqipaxdzk61.png?width=400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=810b77facc34028f1bc7b9cb48f612e42346370b

However this creates a larger wasted transparent area of 3\*sqrt(3)/pi \~= 1.654 \~ 65.4%, and somewhat worse efficiency.

This got me to wonder, what if one decided to instead use three triangles to enclose a circle for rendering. What would the relative wasted transparent area then be?

So, this leads to the question: what kind of configuration of three triangles would enclose a unit circle in such a way that the triangles have minimal area? What would the ratio of the area of these triangles over the area of the unit circle be?

I am having a hard time figuring out what such a configuration of triangles would even look like, and even less how to reason whether such a configuration would be optimal.

If one decided to use as many as six triangles to create a covering, I believe the smallest area covering would form a hex, i.e. looking like

https://preview.redd.it/3vuszm5qhzk61.png?width=256&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e650175b15a6f259a61faa46c7b2865b43ab824c

Here the ratio of triangle over circle area would be 2\*sqrt(3)/pi \~= 1.103 \~ 10.3% lost efficiency, quite a bit down from the 27.3% wasted area of using a square.

But minimal covering using three triangles (or four or five for that matter) really escape me. What would those look like?",math,trejj,False,/r/math/comments/lxh6zh/enclosing_a_circle_using_three_four_or_five/

Does the infinitely-many-primes proof eventually produce all primes?,1614804733,"The standard proof that there are infinitely many primes goes: suppose {p\_1, p\_2, ... , p\_k} is a complete list of primes.

My question is: if we start with just the prime {2} and repeatedly form the number n, factor it, and add new prime factors to our set, will we eventually add every prime to the set? What if we used different starting sets of primes? Are there some which would eventually generate all primes and others which wouldn't?

Question about primes,1614726363,"I’m not sure how best to word this question, so bear with me.

From what I understand, the twin prime conjecture is probably true but hasn’t been proven yet. That is, we believe there are infinitely many primes *p* such that *p+2* is also prime. There is also a family of conjectures about this for all even numbers: there are an infinitely many number of primes *p* such that *p+4* is also prime, etc.

This got me thinking about other families of primes. For example, the numbers 3, 5, and 7 are prime triplets, with a common difference of two. Or the numbers 5, 11, 17, 23, and 29 are prime quintuplets with a common difference of 6.

I’ve realized that for primes *p &gt; 3*, in order to have three primes with common difference *d*, that common difference would need to be a multiple of 3! so that *p*, *p+d*, and *p+2d* would be congruent to equivalent nonzero values mod 3 and mod 2.

Are you aware of any work on these prime families?

Discussing Living Proof: How I Learned to Research Like the Incredible Hulk (or I’m Always Angry) by Robert Vallin,1614704418,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?
**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Why is it that YouTube is better at teaching math than college professors?,1614459109,"So I have been watching a bit of 3blue1brown lately.

Can tax brackets be solved with convolution?,1614449070,"It seems to me that you could calculate taxes owed given a set of tax brackets by adding a set of convolved pairs.

With the current tax bracket system (at least in America where I'm from), you would just convolve two unit steps (f=r_i and g=min(T, L_i+1) - L_i, where r_i is the tax rate for a given bracket ""i"", T is your total income, and L is the lower dollar limit of the tax bracket) and take the result up to x=min(T, L_i+1) - L_i.

So for example:

Making $10,000, and with tax brackets of 10% from $0 to $9,875 and 12% from $9,876 to $40,125, you would add the convolutions of (9875 * 0.1 from x=0 to x=9875) + (124 * 0.12 from x = 0 to 124)

Let me know if I'm still right on this.

Now, I'd probably ask, what's the point? It's just multiplying a number by another number when you get down to it, right? Then I thought about how you could expand that into more complex tax brackets. If you can make a formula for any shape of tax bracket (rather than the flat steps we have now), you could probably make a better tax system, right?

For example, if instead of just 12% for all of $9,876 to $40,125, you ramped up gradually from 12% at $9,876 to 20% at $40,125, then you would just have to have that part of the convolution be a ramp (or g = 2.644715×10−6x + 0.12) (solving for 0.12+𝑥⋅30249=0.2 to get the slope) again starting at x=0 like the unit step before. Then you would just plug that in with the same x limits and you'd be able to just plug and chug, right?

Bayesian model for highly applied decision making in American football,1614443602," 

*In American football, the attacking team is given 4 attempts to go 10 yards and then the team is allowed to continue attacking (possession). And very often, before playing the 4th attempt, the coaches have to decide — try to get the remaining to the minimum 10 yards with the risk of not reaching and giving the ball to the opponent at the current point of the field, or immediately play the punt, thus securing himself in defence. To make this decision easier and more efficient, we will build a Bayesian model in this article.*

*Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of Bayesian Theorem and a solid knowledge of the rules and terminology of American football.*

# A task

Choose to play the punt or play the 4th attempt in the “4 and *j* yards” in situation *i* yards on the field.

# Events

From the statement of the problem, it follows that we must consider two possessions (one of our own and the next after the current one, which the opponent takes). During these two possessions, 4 events can occur, fully describing significant and possible results (several events can occur):

**if we play the 4th attempt:**

* *A*: Our team scores a touchdown after two possessions
* *B*: our team will miss a touchdown after two possessions (including a return touchdown to our touch zone)

**if we play a punt:**

* *С*: our team will miss a touchdown after two possessions
* *D*: Our team scores a touchdown after two possessions (pick-six)

# Decision

## General idea

Thus, the task is reduced to comparing four probabilities:

* *P (A)*: Probability to score a direct touchdown when choosing to play 4th attempt,
* *P (B)*: Probability of missing a touchdown when choosing to play 4th attempt,
* *P (С)*: Probability of missing a touchdown when choosing a punt,
* *P (D)*: Probability to score a touchdown when a punt is selected.

And the choice whether to play the 4th attempt or not comes down to solving the inequality:

## P (A) — P (B)

## ?

## P (C)— P (D)

The events that affect the probabilities on the left side of the inequality are: entered and missed touchdowns on the basis of two possessions, as well as the first down scored on the basis of the 4th attempt.

These events are statistically dependent, we will use Bayesian formula. The problem can be described in terms of the usual theory of probability (and even reduced to it), but in order to show the completeness of the dependences of the probabilities, we will use Bayes’ theorem.

The events on the right side of the inequality are a missed touchdown and a entered touchdown on the basis of two possessions, as well as the number of yards our team will push an opponent back while the punt. The last event (the yards by which the scrimmage line will be moved after the punt) we will take as a constant and take the average value from the statistics. Thus, these events are statistically independent, so we will use the usual unconditional probabilities here.

## 4th attempt play

The probability of entering a touchdown on the decision to play the 4th try, or *P (A)*, depends on whether the 4th try is successful. And it also depends on how successfully our team implements the situation of the first down, on a specific part of the field, to a touchdown. These probabilities fully describe all possible outcomes, and most conveniently, they can be taken from the accumulated (for your own team) statistics:

* *P (X)*: the statistical probability of passing *j* yards in one attempt,
* *P (A | X)*: The statistical probability of getting a touchdown from the *i*\-th yard of the field (from situation 1–10).

*Here we neglect the possible yards gained on the 4th attempt and for simplicity we take i as the current mark of the second marker.*

Passing to the terms of Bayesian theorem, we set *P (A | X)* as the posterior probability under the event *X*, and *P (A)* we set the required prior probability.

Thus, the basic formula of Bayes’ theorem is:

## P (A | X) = (P (X | A) * P (A)) / P (X)

where *P (X | A)* is the probability of realizing the 4th attempt, provided that our team scores a touchdown, which, according to common sense, is equal to one. Thus, our desired prior probability is:

## P (A) = P (A | X) * P (X)

As a result, we consider *P (A)* to be a simple multiplication of the probability of passing *j* yards by the probability of scoring from the *i*\-th yard from situation 1–10. We take both probabilities from statistics.

The probability of missing a touchdown when deciding to play the 4th attempt, or *P (B)*, is the sum of the two prior probabilities:

* *P (Y)*: the probabilities of missing a touchdown when unsuccessful play of the 4th attempt (from the place of its drawing, from situation 1–10 to attack the opponent). Moreover, the probability of an unsuccessful play of the 4th attempt is *1 — X*.
* *P (Z)*: Probabilities of missing a touchdown in case of a successful 4th attempt, for example, when changing possession on the following drives.

These two probabilities are a priori, that is, we must take into account the probability of a successful 4th attempt. That is, in the case of an unsuccessful drawing of the 4th attempt:

## P (Y) = P (Y | (1-X)) * P (1-X)

and in case of a successful drawing of the 4th attempt:

## P (Z) = P (Z | X) * P (X)

For simplicity, let’s take for *P (Z | X)* the simple statistical probability of missing a touchdown after kickoff. Simplifying a little more, we can reduce the probability of missing after kickoff to the probability of missing from *30 + k* yards, that is, from the place where we, on average, move the opponent on the kickoff.

These probabilities fully describe all possible outcomes, and most conveniently, they can be taken from the accumulated (for your own team) statistics.

So, again using Bayesian theorem:

## P (B) = P (Y | (1-X)) * P (1-X) + P (Z | X) * P (X)

And the total damage (after all, we are already in a vulnerable situation when playing the 4th attempt and we consider in which case the damage will be less) from the decision to play the 4th attempt:

## P (A | X) * P (X) — P (Y | (1-X)) * P (1-X) — P (Z | X) * P (X)

The meaning of the expression reduces to calculating the difference in probable touchdowns for two possessions.

## Punt

When playing a punt, we actually give up our attempt (of the two we are considering) and the calculation comes down to the likely damage when our team plays in defense.

To do this, we need to know where the opponent will start his possession and the probability of missing a touchdown. For simplicity, the probability to score a touchdown in the possession of an opponent (pick-six) is assumed to be zero. Thus, *P (D) = 0*.

Alternatively, you can take this value from statistics

For simplicity, we will assume that our team, when play a punt, pushes the opponent back by the same average distance. So, from the accumulated statistics we take:

* *k*: the average number of yards that our team pushes the opponent away by playing the punt, with the returned yards,
* *P (C)*: The statistical probability of missing a touchdown from *i + k* yards on the field (from situation 1–10).

Take the look that *P(C)* is taken for *i + k* yards, that is, for the current position on the field plus the average number of yards after the punt.

# Outcome

To make a decision about whether to play the 4th attempt or to play the punt, one must compare the possible damage (taking into account the possible benefits) from the first decision and the possible damage from the second. Moreover, we can take all the data from the accumulated statistics. In addition, the attentive reader will notice that *P (Y | (1-X)), P (Z | X)* and *P(C)* are the same thing, only they are taken for different *i* or positions on the field.

## P (A | X) * P (X) — P (Y | (1-X)) * P (1-X) — P (Z | X) * P (X)

Thus, having the statistics of the plays for your own team and indicating the current position of the team on the field before the 4th attempt (the number of yards to the first down and the position of the scrimmage line), you can evaluate the chances and choose the most effective outcome.

To demonstrate the idea, I wrote a script in a [jupiter notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1tERuyiN8FwUjn3OP8R6lF8zdkRHH0RJ3?usp=sharing) where you can play around with indicators and position on the field, plus plots showing the distribution of odds in the case of a punt or a play of the 4th attempt.

Accidents in Mathematics,1614434591,"Recently i've been unsure whether i should look into whether two problems are connected, after I saw that their solutions are described by the same integer sequence. 

So my question is: Do you think that some very specific (i'll try to explain that more precisely below) sequences/solutions to different problems can be the same just by accident?

I'm of course not talking about trivial integer sequences like n ; 2^n etc, as these come up again and again, but rather something like a sequence given by a cubic/quartic polynomial. I'm more concerned with the question: if you saw, that two solutions are identical (either a special numerical value or an integer sequence) how convinced would you be that there is some sort of meaningful, constructive bijection between those problems?

Question about linear projections of a curve on a spherical surface,1614431878,"So this is a pretty dumb and inconsequential question, but I figured I would pop it over here to get some group thoughts.

Now, this statement may or may not have been true [for the image it was talking about](http://imgur.com/gallery/DNVEIZl), but it's obviously not *always* true. What I want to know is:

- what criteria must be fulfilled in order for some curve to have a linear projection?
- what criteria must be fulfilled in order for some curve to *not* have a linear projection?

Recurrence Relation Involving Centroids,1614430127,"So say we wanted to find the centroid of the region bounded by the curve y=f(x), y=0, x=1, and x=b. The parametric function obtained would give the path that the centroid ""travels"" as b goes from 1 to infinity. We could then find the centroid of the region bounded by that curve, y=0, x=1, and x = b. From this, you get a sequence of functions and I was wondering if/when does that sequence converge. I found a recursive sequence for the nth set of parametric equations but I don't know how to get the limit as n goes to infinity from there. I think if we start from functions like y=1/x, the sequence will converge but i'm not sure.

How to like doing math?,1614415022," Hi. I like math, but I don't like doing it (I'm 17). I am really inspired by all of those logical dillemas like a code that prints itself, AI, overall everything listed in the famuous talk which you can watch on YT ""The Art Of Code"". It really inspires me but I feel like just staying and doing nothing is more OK than pushing my brain to understand all this.
 Don't get me wrong, even though I feel this way, every day I keep practicing math, it's just that if I don't push myself to do it I won't. And even though I can push with willpower for 4-5h per day, we all know that bruteforce like that is stupud. I need to get in the zone somehow or how you call it..
 I wanna reach a state where I actually go wild and understand all these concepts and have the motivation to do it. I want to be obsessed with math, make it like a drug, get in the zone and do it all time that I'm awake.
 I know it sounds crazy. But I wonder just how some people dive deep and become great at it while others can't dive as deep and need to bruteforce it. I find it really interesting. I just can't do it all day long or do it with as much joy.
 Hard problems rather push me away of the math book than make me attack them and solve them all day long.

Calculus Of Variations Applications,1614381623,"Hey everyone,

In one of my undergrad math classes right now (a class on advanced PDE topics, numerical methods, and other undergrad applied math topics etc), we are doing the calculus of variations and I really really enjoy it. We’ve done some basic examples like proving that the shortest function that connects two points is a straight line, and we recently just did a lecture on newtonian mechanics and the CoV with that and Lagrangian mechanics. 

For this class, instead of a final exam, we have to do a 10-12 page paper and a 20 minute presentation on a topic of our choice that is related to something we cover. My question is, what could be topics to look into (ones that are also the right level of difficulty for the length of the paper/presentation)?

Confused about non-computable numbers,1614367128,"I'm a layman, so please forgive me if the question is dumb. I recently watched this video by numberphile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TkIe60y2GI

In it he talks about non-computable numbers and gives an example of the 'chaitin constant': 'progrability for a certain way of writing a program that a random program stops.' (I actually understand that very well given my background in cs).

For the normal numbers he gives the examples of 'Champernowne's constant', which just puts all number one after the others like this: 
0.123456789101112131415161718...

Afterwards he says we have no example of ""normal non-computable number"".

Here's where I'm confused. Why can't we put these two together?

We don't know the value of chaitin's constant, but we know it exists.

Wouldn't then a normal, non-computable exists, which consists of these two interwined? 

For example if chaitin's constant's value is 0.abcdefghijkl... where the letters are numbers that we cannot compute, it would result in a number like this:

0.0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j10k11l etc....

I know I'm not a mathematicien and surely other people have though of this. Why does it not work?

Fairly good at maths but find it boring,1614353862,"I'm probably gonna get downvoted considering I'm posting this on a subreddit entirely dedicated to maths, but anyway here goes. 

I'm not too bad at maths. I keep up well in my class and usually understand new concepts and problems pretty well, so I don't hate it because I don't ""get"" it and feel like a failure every time I get a test result back.

I also don't care about the fact that I'm learning all these abstract ideas that I will most likely never use in my day to day life, because it is my belief that, we should learn knowledge for the sake of knowledge, because knowledge is power. 

It's just... it's so dull.

Then everything seems to neatly slot into place, and I hurry to get my workings down, as my head churns out the necessary steps in succession, and after that quick burst of exhilaration and excitement, I have an answer. THAT's when I enjoy maths. Particularly if the answer is right.

But the rest of the time I'm practically dying of boredom. The thing that I hate above all else is when I'm given a sheet of about 20 questions, all requiring the same method to solve all of them. It feels so repetitive and... mind numbing, I suppose.

Theorems which have proofs that do not look like what you would expect them to look like,1614351712,"What are some examples of this? I'll give two examples to illustrate what I mean.

1. The prime number theorem says that the number of primes less than n is asymptotically n/log(n). If I had just studied some basic number theory and I saw this statement for the first time, I'd probably expect the proof to involve taking a limit of some sort of clever counting argument. So it would be quite surprising to learn that standard proofs consist almost entirely of complex analysis, rather than working with the primes directly.

2. The Ax-Grothendieck theorem states (in a special case) that every injective polynomial from C^n to C^n is a bijection. I'd expect a proof of this to look like a typical proof making use of tools from complex analysis and topology.

Properties of nested algorithm of absolute value. What exactly is happening?,1614349170,"Sometimes when I was playing with my calculator, I was just randomly hitting some functions repeatedly not really taking too much attention to the results, just looking where it would end up. One day I tried to repeatedly calculate logarithms of absolute value (meaning simply repeating log(abs(Ans))), realizing that *""hey, I could do this forever and it seems I am getting some kind of ""random"" numbers""*.

So I fired up python and created a loop that would repeat this n-times and looked on the [distribution of the values](https://imgur.com/a/LgqOAD4). 

OK nice, lets see if it changes somehow with the starting value (lets call it ""seed""). But maybe it would be nice to quatify it first, so I can make the comparison more valid. So I tried to fit this to some known distribution. (I just simply used the first google search which found [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/37616966) nice a simple method.) The best fit would be Johnson's SU distribution-[fit](https://imgur.com/a/TijMhAY) Using that I tried a different number of seeds and simply compared the sums of squared estimate of [errors.](https://imgur.com/a/aIb8ETU).

And now I do not know what to do next, but I have a few questions:
* Is there a distribution that is describing this exactly/analytically(?) since these numbers are created by nesting logarithms?
* What would be the relation of such distribution to the ""seed""?
* Is this property described somewhere and I just stumbled upon it?
* Can you take it further and do some further interesting analysis/math?

Interestingly, if you inscribe 5 cubes in a dodecahedron, and consider the 10 axes going through two vertices and the center, any cube has 4 axes, and any two cubes have one axis in common, so the dodecahedron encodes this structure nicely, meaning this structure inherits the symmetries of a dodecahedron! (it's fun to try to understand on a gut level why its possible to draw five cubes on the dodecahedron, try it!)

Note that the axioms of a projective plane require that any two lines intersect in one point, and any two points are on one line: this structure fails to have the second property, so is not a projective plane. However, it does have all the lines the same size, which is nice!

We can generalize the above idea, and define a (v,l,s)-pseudo plane to be a set of v vertices and a collection of l lines each containing s points, so that any two lines intersect in a unique point. So in these terms, the structure I described is the unique (10,5,4)-pseudo plane. Note that any subset of the lines of our (10,5,4) pseudo-plane form a (10,k,4) pseudo-plane, but they aren't really interesting: I'm not sure if I should revise the definition to require a certain minimum number of lines, or something else. Lets call a pseudo-plane **maximal** if no lines can be added if you keep to the axioms.

Have these been studied, and do they have a nice standard name? I can prove the existence of a nice (n(n+1)/2,n+1,n) pseudo plane (it looks similar to the pattern in my first picture), and I can prove its uniqueness for n=2,3,4; are these unique in general? If we fix v and s, what is the maximum l we can obtain?

"Mathematician ""Archetypes""",1614271048,"Would people say there are different types of mathematicians? I wonder if there are different types of mathematicians who, because of their different styles/approaches, tend to perform various differing roles. For example:

I feel like I'm more of a ""tortoise"". I like to study a topic and really try and understand it, what it links to and why. I tend to make sure my foundations are good before I try and build on them. I like seeing the system and how it is/can be organised into a coherent whole. I guess you'd say I like to make sure the i's are dotted and the t's crossed.

I've observed other people who I've seen as more like ""hares"". They like new things and going ahead with them without initially worrying about how well they understand them. They tend to come back and fill in any gaps they discover when they run into problems. I guess you'd say they like pushing ahead with new things.

Another type might be people who are not necessarily so great at making big breakthroughs in research, but they are brilliant at pulling together material and writing great textbooks that help others get into a new area.

The goal of number theory,1614249917,"Hello altogether, first post here.
At my first contact with number theory, I got the impression that it is mainly about solving Diophantine equations and describing the behavior of integer primes/ computing prime factorization.

This semester I had my first university class in Algebraic Number Theory; and apart from Pells Equation, Pythagorean triples, and proving the case n=4 of Fermat (which all happend pretty much in the beginning), we did not really bother much with solving Diophantine equations.

Later we focused mainly on prime factorization in Dedekind domains, computing the class number and valuation theory.(Which are all pretty cool, but I did not really see why this is of number theoretical interest).

So I guess my question is: Are these more general topics somewhat still related with the original question of solving Diophantine equation, or do they tell us something about the behavior of integer primes? Or do they give us some neat insight into the behavior of integers? Why are these topics still ""number theory"" and not ""commutative algebra""?",math,Doofenshmirtz4427,False,/r/math/comments/ls3unh/the_goal_of_number_theory/
Unexpected crossovers,1614249353,"Hey everyone, 

So I'm studying maths at university right now and i have been very intrigued by maths from one area appearing in different areas.

For example, this semester I took a course in algebraic groups and as it turns out there is a very big connection to differential geometry and even combinatorics, when you study lie algebras, tangent spaces and root systems. Similarly, something that is not as surprising if you have studied any probability theory, but was still very exciting to me when I first heard about it, is the fact that the entire field is based on measure theory which I thus far only knew from analysis.

So what are your unexpected/surprising connections between seemingly unrelated fields of maths and how did you learn about them?

Math background for CS Theory,1614172362,"Hi, I'm contemplating studying a PhD in CS theory (statistical machine learning theory) at a highly competitive school's AI lab (one of Berkeley/Stanford/MIT) that I was (somehow) admitted to. However, I'm concerned my weak math background will put me at a disadvantage and that I should instead pursue a more applied field of study. In particular,

1) I never did any math competitions/olympiads or advanced classes as a kid; I only ""got into"" serious math during college. Unfortunately, it seems that the vast majority (no exaggeration) of my potential fellow students are former IMO medalists or Putnam finalists. Since mathematics is akin to gymnastics---you need to start at a very young age to stand a chance in the big leagues---I'm concerned this means I'll struggle to stand out during my PhD. In turn, I may not receive as much attention from my advisor and will struggle to compete for TT positions after graduation.

2)  My math foundations are weak. Although I'm very comfortable working with certain topics (e.g. probability/stats/algorithms/complexity/etc.) in my math research, I can't even solve ""well-known"" IMO questions without looking up solutions. The number theory tricks and proof techniques that my classmates learned during their ""math camps"" seem alien to me.

Before I commit myself to 6 difficult years, I was just curious about what it takes to ""stand out"" in the CS theory community and the honest extent to which my upbringing will limit me.

The MAA's Instructional Practices Guide (in response to criticism of equitablemath.org),1614105387,"In wake of the criticisms of the website https://equitablemath.org/ that have been making the rounds in several subreddits, I would like to share the [Mathematical Association of America's Instructional Practices Guide](https://www.maa.org/programs-and-communities/curriculum%20resources/instructional-practices-guide) (here's a [direct link to the pdf](https://www.maa.org/sites/default/files/InstructPracGuide_web.pdf)), and a few excerpts which touch on exactly what the website is discussing. 

&gt; This Instructional Practices Guide aims to share effective, evidence-based practices instructors can use to facilitate meaningful learning for students of mathematics. [...] With that big picture in mind, this guide is written from the perspective that teaching and learning are forces for social change. Beyond the confines of individual instructors’ classrooms, beyond their decisions about what mathematics to teach and how to teach it, there are societal forces that call upon all mathematics instructors to advocate for increased student access to the discipline of mathematics. Inequity exists in many facets of our society, including within the teaching and learning of mathematics. Because access to success in mathematics is not distributed fairly, the opportunities that accompany success in mathematics are also not distributed fairly. We in the mathematical sciences community should not affirm this inequitable situation as an acceptable status quo. We owe it to our discipline, to ourselves, and to society to disseminate mathematical knowledge in ways that increase individuals’ access to the opportunities that come with mathematical understanding.

And further on under ""Equity in Practice:""

&gt; The number of mathematics degrees awarded at the undergraduate and graduate levels provides insight into the impact of institutional cultures and instructional practices on women and historically underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). In 2012, only 20% of bachelors, 18% of masters,  and  8%  of doctoral degrees in mathematics were awarded to black,  Latinx, Native American, Native Alaskan, and Hawaiian students combined (National Science Board, 2014) despite the fact that these racial groups composed approximately 30% of the U.S. population at that time. Further, the 2010 survey of mathematics departments conducted every five years by the Conference Board of the Mathematical Sciences (CBMS) indicated members of these underrepresented groups composed only 9% of the full-time mathematics instructors (CBMS, 2013); while women made up 29% of these full-time instructors, only 3% were women of color.

&gt; Research has revealed additional and sometimes hidden stressors placed on women and students of color as they navigate undergraduate and graduate mathematics. McGee and Martin detailed how academically successful black undergraduates pursuing mathematics and engineering majors faced racial stereotypes of low ability and underachievement. Experiences in undergraduate mathematics classes have also been shown to contribute to women’s decisions to leave STEM fields despite the fact that they are well-prepared and fully capable of succeeding in these fields. Such research suggests our community needs to critically examine factors well beyond students’ academic preparation and achievements in our quest to increase students’ success in STEM.

&gt; Fixation in higher education on low achievement rates among women and students of color in mathematics, coupled with erroneous notions that mathematical ability is innate and fixed, contribute to the prevalent deficit perspective of these underrepresented groups, especially among a predominantly white teaching force. Such deficit perspectives, that focus on what students cannot do, often result in instructors reducing the rigor of mathematical tasks and assessments, avoiding instructional strategies that engage students in higher-level reasoning, and failing to build positive relationships with students from these groups. It is incumbent upon us to consider classroom, assessment, and design practices that affirm our students and provide equitable access to rich mathematical learning opportunities for all. We must challenge the deficit perspective among the broader mathematical sciences community and help our colleagues broaden their notions of mathematical competence and success while still maintaining high levels of rigor and standards of performance.

The point here is that, if ""math education may support white supremacy"" sounds too harsh, then instead I'll say ""math education tends to favor whites and males over minorities and women, and this is a problem,"" and this is not some fringe view held by some crank website or organization, but rather recognized by *one of the largest mathematical associations in America*. Research has demonstrated that some teaching practices seem to favor those coming from a select few backgrounds and restrict mathematics to those select few, while others seem to benefit students regardless of background - they are ""equitable"" practices. 

Though we wouldn't like to think that by simply teaching mathematics, we're creating negative learning outcomes and favoring some students of certain backgrounds over others, it happens if we are not careful. We need to take conscious efforts to implement learning techniques that are equitable and remove implicit bias from our classrooms if we want to not just be antiracist in spirit but in practice. I'm aware that it's not a pleasant thought that as educators, we can propagate racism, but I'm not sure why on earth it is so hard for some people to accept that modern education, a system influenced by our culture's extremely racist past, and a collection of techniques handed down from generation to generation, may have some lingering forms of implicit racism still lingering within it. Especially when the statistics clearly demonstrate that clearly, there is something in the mathematics classroom that is favoring predominantly young white and Asian kids. In almost every practice, there exist remnants of racist practices that go unchecked, simply accepted, until someone (or an internet horde) finally questions ""hey, why do we keep doing this?"" or something similar. Math education is no exception, and the questioning has been happening for a bit now.

As for the objectivity part - as nice as it would be to pretend that math happens in a vacuum and is purely objective (actually that wouldn't be very nice at all IMO), this isn't the case, as we are all human and have human factors affecting our ability to learn (or teach). Pretending math is purely objective only exacerbates the problem at hand. Quoting /u/functor7 from the other thread who put it better than I can, 

&gt; As for the ""objectivity"" thing, as others have mentioned, you're blowing it out of proportion due to your commitments to your own ontological stance about math. Regardless of math's ontological stance, we only learn about it, create it, and do it within specific social contexts. Our relationship to math - which determines how we do it, how we think about it, how we create it, how we interpret it, and how we solve problems (so, everything) - is highly subjective and dependent on sociological, political, and economic influences. If we ignore this reality, then we blind ourselves to these influences and cannot become critical of them or counter them when they become harmful.

&gt; This leads to extreme underrepresentation in math by people of color, and creates a ""leaky pipeline"" for women mathematicians. And a system which excludes people of color and women I would think would be considered a part of ""white patriarchal supremacy"", since, usually, white men find it easier to succeed. When people hear these words - white supremacy, patriarchy, etc - they tend to individualize it: Only bad people who are racist and sexist and explicitly think they are better than others can do this. But that's not the case. The success and danger of these things is that they work through everyone - you, me, everyone. And to fix it, we can't focus on individuals, but try to address the actual systems in place and change them as much as we can.",math,Redrot,False,/r/math/comments/lqpi3q/the_maas_instructional_practices_guide_in/

Strange developments in maths teaching,1614072210,"Hi folks,

A friend send me this link: [https://equitablemath.org/](https://equitablemath.org/) wanting me to comment on it. As somebody who is right now studying for his final exams and being the son of two math teachers, this baffles me. Dont get me wrong, some of the stuff on this page is just good conduct for teachers, but some is really insane.

There is no objectivity in math? I mean, come on. This just ignores decades of fruitful philosophical and logical work on this topic. And well yes, there is ambiguity in ""maths"" as a field. But school maths is more like ""calculations"" and will never even get close to this. Everything teached in school math is completely objective and easily provable.

I really only see students that had their math teachers follow these guidelines failing bad as soon as they need to get university maths into their system. The only solution would be correcting university maths downward, too.... which would suck.

I mean, we are in this trend already, arent we? Comparing the books my mother used when she started teaching 25 years ago with those she gets today, it already got pretty bad. So what the hell is this now?

Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to share with people that have more insights than the layman.

EDIT: This has blown up quite a bit. Thanks for all the serious discussion and different viewpoints on this.

This is one of those patterns.

The number 7 and its multiples appear 1 in 7 times on the number line. If you roll a prime die and multiply your roll by three, then roll another die until you get a different number than you originally rolled, the sum of those rolls will be to be equal to 7 or one of its multiples more than 1 in 7 times. I can't prove this for all P, but the data I've crunched looks - at the very least - interesting.

Probability someone you know died of Covid,1614046182,"In America we just hit half a million deaths to Covid. At a population of around 330 million, this is around 1 in every 660 person.

The simplest possible model is to say that the probability a random American has died of Covid is 1/660. If we keep to the back of the napkin and make the (poor) assumption that Covid deaths are independent, then the probability that at least one person out of a group of N has died from Covid is:

1 - (659/660)^N

Ramanujan's Taxi Cab Two: Electric Boogaloo,1614030039,"I'm sure we're all familiar with Ramanujan's Taxi Cab problem, right? Sum of two cubes, two different ways? I decided to scale this up a little, and find the smallest number that can be represented as the sum of two cubes, THREE different ways. I'm no Srinivasa, so I wrote some Mathematica code to find it for me. Incidentally, I found the first 8 numbers for which this is the case, since I tested up to 2 billion. Curiously, all results were less than a billion. I wasn't sure where else to put this, so here you go internet. Enjoy!

&amp;#x200B;

THE SMALLEST SUM OF TWO CUBES THREE DIFFERENT WAYS:

87539319 = 414\^3 + 255\^3 = 423\^3 + 228\^3 = 436\^3 + 167\^3

&amp;#x200B;

The other seven:  
119824488 = 428\^3 + 346\^3 = 492\^3 + 90\^3 = 493\^3 + 11\^3  
143604279 = 423\^3 + 408\^3 = 460\^3 + 359\^3 = 522\^3 + 111\^3  
175959000 = 525\^3 + 315\^3 = 552\^3 + 198\^3 = 560\^3 + 70\^3  
327763000 = 580\^3 + 510\^3 = 661\^3 + 339\^3 = 670\^3 + 300\^3  
700314552 = 828\^3 + 510\^3 = 846\^3 + 456\^3 = 872\^3 + 334\^3  
804360375 = 920\^3 + 295\^3 = 927\^3 + 198\^3 = 930\^3 + 15\^3  
958595904 = 856\^3 + 692\^3 = 984\^3 + 180\^3 = 986\^3 + 22\^3

"I have given up completely, and i do not intent on fixing it.",1614029852,"So, where do i start with my relationship (Or rather abusive arranged marriage in the last years).  I used to be really really good at math up until 9th grade, i never got anything below A in the american GPA scale. Then came 9th grade and my first exam was 84 points which would make it 2 points short of a A- , Which i took for granted. It isnt bad, it was really high actually.

then came the second exam, which was 20... That one fucking exam became my bane of existance. My math teacher(s) were shit all trought 9-11. first one was a bloody fucking grandpa who should be put in a retirement home and left to rot. seriously dude was cute and all but he fucked my foundation, i hope he goes to hell. he fucked every one of me and my friends to the core. Then came the second year with a woman who's ego rivals a victorian parading trough a colony. She was more inclined with her self image than to teach us. And with my own hot head at the time, i simply didnt give to shits. I got a 20, 30. Got an assignment project and did my ''Homework'' and passed. then came 11th grade and thanks to corona lockdowns i passed. I had selected the mathematical path in my school out of family pressure CAUSE APPEREANTLY IF I DONT BECOME ANYTHING SHORT OF A ENGINEER I AM WORTHLESS, I have now come to 12th grade and cannot do jackshit in math, thanks to shit teaching and general lazyness from myself i have done nothing.

It isnt to say i didnt try, infact in the summer last year. I said to myself ''Maybe you have been on your ass for the last 3 years you fucking cunt, you have god knows how many months infront of you, study and overcome it like all theese ""ewribodi cwan dow mawth"" professors say.'' Which i tried only to fail miserably, i worked day in day out for 2 months just to go to nowhere, I still did shit at tests and got wrong awnsers most of the time and i gave up, it made me feel stupid and retarded. Thats when i discovered i had a really good memorization of written articles, history, law, literature and so on. At that point i reminded myself ''Not everyone can be an engineer, not everyone has too, theese 2 retards called my parents arent. yet one of them served for 24 years in the military as a offier and my mother was doing pretty good in trade.''

I have decided that i wanted to study law. Which i was profound of, i have a really good ability on charming, convincing and my thought process isn't ''dead or cognially lower'' like all theese 130+ iq bafoons would like to suggest (Infact it is 131. I paid for that shit) My puzzle solving abilities are great and i have found what i really wanted to do. I will not be needing math for my career as a lawyer  or judge. But yet here i am still unable to get basic algebra 2 down yet alone pre-calc. I just cannot man. 

I feel like i am in a iki ucu boklu değnek situation, on one hand my math is thoroughbred shit and my scientific classes are great. (My physics and chemistry have been great and i never failed once.) yet to enter law school i still must take math in the university exams, since i selected the mathamatical path i, by law have to fill in the math and scientific classes  portions in my spreadsheet, or else my exam wouldnt count valid. I can aditionally fill in the Turkish language and literature portion to also get a ranking in the ""equally balanced"" path(The one you must select to enter law school, it requires you to complete math and turkish language sections) I may take the aditional part but this will strain my already cramped time even shorter.  

I just feel like shit at the current moment, I am thinking about failing class this year to transfer myself to the equally balanced path and maybe get 1 more year for myself to study. I really hate that i cannot chase my passion since there is this retarded thing called math in the way. Which i will never need academically once i win law school. Some people really cannot do math and it doesnt make sense to beat a dead horse. I want some honest opinions. My family are nothing but bloody baphoons on this regard, i feel lonely and angry.

Brownian motion and the heat equation on domains with boundary and/or manifolds,1613958061,"On Euclidean space, (d-dimensional) Brownian motion is intimately related to the heat kernel, where if $$f$$ is sufficiently nice initial data on $$\\mathbb{R\^d}$$ and $$W\_x(t)$$ is a Brownian motion started at position $$x$$, then the solution to the heat equation with initial data $$f$$ is given at time $$t$$ by $$E\[f(W\_x(t))\]$$, with the expectation ranging over all Brownian motions starting at $$x$$ and running for $$t$$ units of time. While reading a paper, I saw that this relation holds as well for bounded domains in Euclidean space, but was not familiar with this result, or even with how Brownian motion was defined on proper subdomains of Euclidean space.

&gt; John Willard Milnor (born February 20, 1931) is an American mathematician known for his work in differential topology, K-theory and dynamical systems. Milnor is a distinguished professor at Stony Brook University and one of the six mathematicians to have won the Fields Medal, the Wolf Prize, and the Abel Prize.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; One of his published works is his proof in 1956 of the existence of 7-dimensional spheres with nonstandard differential structure. Later, with Michel Kervaire, he showed that the 7-sphere has 15 differentiable structures (28 if one considers orientation).
&gt; 
&gt; An n-sphere with nonstandard differential structure is called an exotic sphere, a term coined by Milnor.

From the [Wikipedia article on Exotic Spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere):

&gt; In differential topology, an exotic sphere is a differentiable manifold M that is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard Euclidean n-sphere. That is, M is a sphere from the point of view of all its topological properties, but carrying a smooth structure that is not the familiar one (hence the name ""exotic"").

---

To get the numbers of Exotic Spheres though, one must first compute the Stable Homotopy Groups of Spheres.

In January 2020 (with an update in June), **Daniel C. Isaksen and Guozhen Wang and Zhouli Xu** computed ""the stable homotopy groups up to dimension 90, except for some carefully enumerated uncertainties"" in their paper **[More Stable Stems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.04511)**.

From the Introduction of the paper (bold added by me):

&gt; The computation of stable homotopy groups of spheres is one of the most fundamental and important problems in homotopy theory. It has connections to many topics in topology, such as the cobordism theory of framed manifolds, **the classification of smooth structures on spheres**, obstruction theory, the theory of topological modular forms, algebraic K-theory, motivic homotopy theory, and equivariant homotopy theory.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite their simple definition, which was available eighty years ago, these groups are notoriously hard to compute. All known methods only give a complete answer through a range, and then reach an obstacle until a new method is introduced. The standard approach to computing stable stems is to use Adams type spectral sequences that converge from algebra to homotopy. In turn, to identify the algebraic E2-pages, one needs algebraic spectral sequences that converge from simpler algebra to more complicated algebra. For any spectral sequence, difficulties arise in computing differentials and in solving extension problems. Different methods lead to trade-offs. One method may compute some types of differentials and extension problems efficiently, but leave other types unanswered, perhaps even unsolvable by that technique. To obtain complete computations, one must be eclectic, applying and combining different methodologies. Even so, combining all known methods, there are eventually some problems that cannot be solved. **Mahowald’s uncertainty principle states that no finite collection of methods can completely compute the stable homotopy groups of spheres.**
&gt; 
&gt; Because stable stems are finite groups (except for the 0-stem), the computation is most easily accomplished by working one prime at a time. At odd primes, the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence and the chromatic spectral sequence, which are based on complex cobordism and formal groups, have yielded a wealth of data [36]. As the prime grows, so does the range of computation. For example, at the primes 3 and 5, we have complete knowledge up to around 100 and 1000 stems respectively [36].
&gt; 
&gt; **The prime 2, being the smallest prime, remains the most difficult part of the computation.** In this case, the Adams spectral sequence is the most effective tool.
&gt; 
&gt; [...]
&gt; 
&gt; This document describes the results of this systematic program through the 90-stem. We anticipate that our approach will allow us to compute into even higher stems, especially towards the last unsolved Kervaire invariant problem in dimension 126.

Since the resolution of this conjecture essentially completes this field of study, I thought it would be a good idea to post a reasonably broad discussion of it and its significance.

In this post I will summarise this research program and the significance of the paper, and where people in the field will likely turn to next.

##Introduction

Going all the way back to the beginning, the problem starts with what pure mathematicians actually want to do with themselves. The way I like to think of it is this: pure mathematicians want to find mathematical structures, understand their properties, understand the links between them, and *classify them* (that is, completely understand which objects can exist and hopefully what they all look like). Each of these is an important part of the pure mathematical process, but it is the last one is in some sense the ""end"" of a given theory, and what I will focus on.

In geometry, classification is an old and interesting problem, going back to Euclid's elements, where the Platonic solids (Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Icosahedron, Dodecahedron) were completely classified. This is a fantastic classification: pick a class of geometric structures (convex regular 3-dimensional polytopes) and produce a comprehensive list (there are 5, and here is how to construct them...). Another great classification is the [classification of closed oriented surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_\(topology\)#Classification_of_closed_surfaces) up to homeomorphism/diffeomorphism. For each non-negative integer *g* called the genus, we associated a surface with *g* holes in it. 

##Higher dimensional classification

As you pass to more complicated geometric structures and higher dimensions, the issue becomes more complicated, for a variety of reasons. Perhaps the most obvious is that **classification of all geometric structures is impossible.** This is meant in a precise sense: a classification should be some kind of list or rule which can produce all possible structures of a given type. However it can be proven that every finitely presented group appears as the fundamental group of a manifold of dimension at least four (in fact, you can even just take symplectic manifolds!). Since the classification of finitely presented groups is impossible (this is the [word problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_problem_for_groups), which is equivalent to the Halting problem and is therefore impossible), any attempt to classify geometric spaces in a way which preserves fundamental groups (i.e. up to homotopy, homeomorphism, diffeomorphism) is also impossible.

This leaves geometers in a bit of a bind: if we can't ever classify *all* geometric structures, which ones do we turn our attention to first? There are two possibilities: weaken our notion of equivalence to something so broad that we can again classify all objects (but what is weaker than weak homotopy??), or be more specific in what kinds of geometric objects we want to classify (i.e. restrict to small classes, such as regular convex polytopes or closed oriented surfaces, etc.), or some combination of the two. Many different such families have been now classified (see 3-manifolds/the Poincare conjecture, classifying higher dimensional topological manifolds up to surgery, classifying algebraic surfaces up to birational transformation, classifying Fano 3-folds up to deformation class).

Beyond the low-dimensional examples I mentioned above, geometers are left with the question: what classes of higher dimensional spaces do we try to classify first?

## Physics

One answer to this problem of what do we try to classify first is given by physics. Just as pure mathematicians were starting to wake up to this way of thinking in the first half of the 20th century, in walks Einstein. Einstein says: the geometric spaces which are most natural to study are those which satisfy [my equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations). To a differential geometer these equations essentially say: these are the Riemannian manifolds with a sort of **uniform curvature**. In two dimensions this is very precise: Einstein manifolds have *constant* curvature (and the classification of such manifolds is called the [uniformisation theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformization_theorem), which is something to think about for those of you taking a first course in algebraic curves!). In higher dimensions being Einstein is a condition of uniform Ricci curvature. 

ASIDE: Ricci curvature is a quantity which measure the extent to which the volume of a ball in your space differs from the volume of a standard ball in Euclidean space. The idea is that a very curved space will have larger Ricci curvature (volume of a hemisphere is 3 pi r^2, volume of the corresponding disk is pi (1/2 pi r)^2 = pi^2/4 r^2, so the positive curvature of the sphere has increased the volume of a disk centered at the north pole). Asking for the Ricci curvature to be proportional to the metric (Einstein condition) asks for this variation of volume to be uniform over your space. Einstein manifolds are the most uniformly curved of all Riemannian manifolds.

Since the Einstein condition makes good sense in pure differential geometry, geometers decided to run with this as a working definition of what kind of spaces to try and classify. If you look through 20th century differential geometry, it is full of people studying Einstein manifolds in various dimensions. One of the crowning achievements of this perspective is of course Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture, which used the Ricci flow (basically a flow which takes a Riemannian 3-fold towards being Einstein) to classify 3-manifolds (this classification is called the [geometrisation conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrization_conjecture)).

However, classifying Einstein manifolds is **hard**. The Einstein equations are non-linear PDEs on non-linear spaces, and beyond the simplest possible examples, solving such differential equations is very very difficult. Even solving non-linear PDEs on *linear* spaces is too hard for us (the Navier--Stokes problem is a Millenium prize problem for goodness sake!). During the latter half of the 20th century therefore, geometers took an interlude into studying **vector bundles** instead: these are types of manifolds which have a semi-linear structure. They (locally) look like products of manifolds (non-linear) with vector spaces (linear).

Again we ask: what kind of vector bundles should be attempt to classify? And again the physicists answer: **Yang--Mills vector bundles**. I won't get too much into this long and very beautiful story, which culminates on the physics side with the standard model of particle physics and on towards string theory, and on the mathematics side with the [Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi%E2%80%93Hitchin_correspondence), except to say two things.

1. The condition for a vector bundle to admit a Yang--Mills connection is eerily similar to the condition for a manifold to admit an Einstein metric: it is a kind of uniformity condition on a curvature tensor. This explains the many analogies between the study of vector bundles and the study of manifolds which I am about to tell you about.

2. It is possible (at least in the case where the base manifold is a compact complex manifold) to construct a correspondence between solutions of this very difficult PDE (the Yang--Mills equations) and **algebraic geometry**. This correspondence (the Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence) is so great, that you can turn the existence of solutions into a problem of checking (in principle) a finite number of inequalities of rational numbers that depend only on the topology of your vector bundle and the holomorphic subbundles inside it!

It is because of point 2 that we pass now from differential geometry and physics into algebraic geometry: for some very deep reason (which requires a whole other long post to explain) **extremal objects in differential geometry and physics correspond to stable objects in algebraic geometry**, and (at least in principle), **stability of an algebraic object can be explicitly checked in examples**. 

ASIDE: For those of you interested in string theory, point 2 is also (one of the) source(s) of why algebraic geometry is so fundamental to string theory. The others are the intimate relationship between Einstein metrics and algebraic geometry (the main subject of my post) and the relationship between symplectic geometry and algebraic geometry (again, would require a whole other post to get into).

##Einstein metrics on complex manifolds and algebraic geometry

We now turn to the subject of the preprint put up today. Einstein tells us that we should try to classify Einstein manifolds first, and the case of vector bundles tells us that, at least when we are in the realm of complex geometry, studying Einstein manifolds *might* correspond to something in algebraic geometry. This leads us to our first Fields medal:

In the 1960s, Shing--Tung Yau proved the [Calabi conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calabi_conjecture), which gives conditions under which a compact complex manifold admits an Einstein metric in the case where the **first Chern class c_1(X) = 0.** This is a number associated to a manifold which tells you about its topological twisting, and having c_1(X)=0 means the manifold is **not topologically twisted**. Another name for such manifolds is now **Calabi--Yau manifolds**, and these are precisely the manifolds of interest in string theory (note that not being *topologically twisted* can be thought of as a kind of precursor to not being *metrically twisted*, i.e. that you can solve the Einstein equations). 

Yau's proof of the Calabi conjecture basically says that: in the case where c_1(X)=0 (no topological twisting), you can **always solve the Einstein problem**. No more qualifications are needed. Earlier Aubin and Yau had also proven the same theorem in the case where c_1(X)&lt;0 (you might call this ""negative topological twisting""). For Yau's proof of the Calabi--Conjecture, a very very hard problem in geometric analysis, he was awarded the Fields medal.

However, the story is not over, because this left the third case, the ""positive topological twisting"" case c_1(X)&gt;0. Such manifolds are called **Fano manifolds**, because Gino Fano had earlier studied the same condition positivity condition for algebraic varieties deeply in the first half of the 20th century and had gotten his name attached to them. The very difficult analysis estimates Yau proved in the case c_1(X)&lt;0 and c_1(X)=0 break in the case c_1(X)&gt;0, and there was no way to fix it: Lichnerowicz and Matsushima had proven that there exists complex manifolds with c_1(X)&gt;0 which *don't* admit Einstein metrics.

## Fano manifolds and K-stability

From now on I will switch to the term Kahler--Einstein (KE), which is what Einstein metrics are referred to in complex/algebraic geometry. This is simply a compatibility condition between the metric and the complex structure.

Now for a brief interlude and another Fields medal:

After Yau's work in the 1960s and 1970s, as previously mentioned geometers turned to the case of vector bundles. In the 1980s the Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence was proven, relating existence of solutions to a very hard PDE (Yang--Mills equations) to algebraic geometry (stable vector bundles). This was proven in the simplest possible case (where the base manifold is a Riemann surface) by Simon Donaldson in his PhD thesis, where he also studied the same problem on the [complex projective plane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_projective_plane). In the same thesis he proved his famous results about the topology of four-manifolds, and for this work he was awarded a Fields medal (despite the fact that it only made up about a third of his PhD thesis!). Following on from this, Donaldson proved the HK correspondence for algebraic surfaces (the next simplest case) a few years later, and a few years after that Yau returned to prove the theorem in general for any compact Kahler manifold, along with [Karen Uhlenbeck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Uhlenbeck), a tremendous geometric analyst and advocate for women in mathematics who was recently awarded the Abel prize for her contributions to the subject, in large part for this work. 

Carrying on, inspired by this correspondence, Yau conjectured in the early 1990s that there should be an algebraic stability condition analogous to slope stability of vector bundles (i.e. a kind of inequality of rational numbers) such that stability w.r.t this criterion guarantees the existence of a KE metric when c_1(X)&gt;0.

A few years after that, Gang Tian (a former PhD student turned arch-nemesis of Yau's) in 1997 defined such a condition, which he called K-stability after a certain functional called the K-energy defined by Toshiki Mabuchi, a Japanese mathematician who had been working away at these problems in the 1980s. The K has remained reasonably mysterious for a long time now, and most people mistakenly think it stands for Kahler. Recently we contacted Mabuchi directly and asked him, and apparently the K stands for Kanonisch, the german word for canonical (c_1(X)&gt;0 is a condition on the *canonical bundle of X*), as well as for Kinetic energy (since he was working on a functional that is a lot like kinetic energy). 

Gang Tian's condition for K-stability of Fano varieties was not purely algebraic in nature, and in 2001 Simon Donaldson returned to give a purely algebro-geometric definition of K-stability, and clarrified exactly what kind of rational number inequalities one should need. To summarise, this lead to the following conjecture (the statement of which I have simplified slightly):
&gt; **Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture**: A Fano manifold (or smooth Fano variety) admits a Kahler--Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable.

This conjecture is a direct analogue for varieties of the Hitchin--Kobayashi correspondence for vector bundles, and the 2000s were spent by Donaldson and Tian and their various research programs religiously trying to prove it. This conjecture was resolved in the affirmative by Chen--Donaldson--Sun in 2012, using some very very difficult mathematics including Gromov compactness of Riemannian manifolds and other high-powered machinery developed by Tian and others during the preceeding decade, and for this work they were awarded the Veblen prize.

ASIDE: About a day after CDS put their proof of the YTD conjecture on the arxiv, Tian put up his own proof with several key lemmas apparently plagarised, and several key details missing. This caused [quite a controversy](https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/~skdona/KEDEVELOPMENTS-9-19-2013.PDF) and the community is still somewhat split on who to attribute credit to, although people outside Tian's circle largely credit CDS. Several more proofs of the YTD conjecture have emerged in the years afterwards by various authors. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-stability#Yau%E2%80%93Tian%E2%80%93Donaldson_Conjecture) for a summary.

In the aftermath of CDS's proof of the YTD conjecture, attention turned to the case of *singular Fano varieties*. These are objects of familiarity to algebraic geometers, which scare differential geometers who cannot work on anything that isn't smooth. A lot of very powerful machinery is currently being developed to understand singularities from the perspective of differential geometry right now, called non-Archimidean geometry, and is likely to have a significant impact on the subject in the future (as of right now, Chi Li is attempting to prove a generalisation of the YTD conjecture using non-Archimidean geometry, and Yang Li is making large strides in our understanding of mirror symmetry and the SYZ conjecture using NA geometry also).

## Fano varieties with singularities, classification, and K-stability

Now we finally return to the problem of classification. In algebraic geometry, classification is not as impossible as it is in general. Because of the more rigid and more restrictive structure of algebraic varieties, it is sometimes possible to completely classify them. This has been achieved for algebraic curves (uniformisation theorem) and compact algebraic surfaces (essentially by the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the first half of the 20th century), as well as for (deformation classes of) Fano threefolds at the end of the 20th century.

However, some concessions need to be made: it is not generally possible to classify **all** algebraic varieties of a given type. Instead you must throw away some bad ones, which David Mumford in the 1960s (under the command of Alexander Grothendieck, who had enlisted him as the man to find how to make moduli spaces in algebraic geometry) coined as **unstable** (in analogy with stability in classical mechanics). The rest of them, the stable ones, could be formed into a **moduli space** (a term invented by Riemann when he built the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces in the 1860s, moduli means parameter), a geometric space in its own right whose points correspond to algebraic varieties: nearby algebraic varieties in the moduli space are similar, and far away algebraic varieties are dissimilar.

The classification problem in algebraic geometry then becomes to build a moduli space of stable algebraic varieties, at which point the area is considered ""done"". ASIDE: Some work is being done on the unstable algebraic varieties by the school of Frances Kirwan using so-called ""non-reductive geometric invariant theory"", a complicated mix of algebraic geometry, symplectic geometry, and representation theory.

To build a good moduli space, one needs several things, which brings us to our third Fields medal in this story:

It is absolutely not obvious that a moduli space of varieties should be finite-dimensional, and to get this property requires a technical notion called **boundedness**. In 2016 Caucher Birkar, an inspiring Kurdish mathematican whose chosen name means ""migrant mathematician"", proved the boundedness of (mildly singular) Fano varieties using some very difficult birational geometry, and for this he was awarded a Fields medal. This forms an important part of the classification problem for Fanos.

Another thing you need is **properness** (or compactness if you are a differential geometer), which requires you to complete the boundary of the moduli space using singular objects. For this purpose the algebraic geometers study so-called **Q**-log Fano varieties instead of just Fano varieties. Using non-Archimedean geometry, it is possible to define a notion of *weak Kahler--Einstein metric* for such spaces, and you can even phrase a generalisation of the YTD conjecture in this case:

&gt;**Yau--Tian--Donaldson conjecture for singular Fanos:** A **Q**-log Fano variety admits a weak Kahler--Einstein metric if and only if it is K-stable.

The final thing algebraic geometers wanted was a so-called **optimal degeneration**, which is a certain object that precisely characterises how bad an unstable Q-log Fano is. I won't say any more about these.

During the 2010s a lot of mathematicians worked on these problems, including Berman, Boucksom, Jonsson, Fujita, Odaka, Donaldson, Chenyang Xu, and many others I am forgetting, improved our understanding of K-stability of Q-log Fano's until the entire research program, including properness of the moduli space, the existence of optimal degenerations, and the proof of the YTD conjecture for singular Fanos, were reduced to the resolution of a single conjecture in commutative algebra/algebraic geometry, which I will vaguely state:

&gt;**Finite generation conjecture**: Certain graded rings inside the ring of functions of a **Q**-log Fano variety are finitely generated.

In the article of Liu--Xu--Zhuang put on the arxiv today, they have proven this conjecture in the affirmative, and thus in some sense completed the study of K-stability and Kahler--Einstein metrics for Fano varieties. 

It is not clear where the theory will go from here. The (in principle tractable) problem of actually finding and computing the K-stability of examples of Fano varieties is still open for a lot of exploration, and there are natural generalisations of this entire body of work to the case of non-Fano varieties and constant scalar curvature Kahler (cscK) metrics, but the resolution of this problem certainly marks the end of an era in complex geometry.

For those of you interested, I am sure I or others can give low level explanations of some of the technical objects appearing in my post, such as complex manifolds, Kahler manifolds, Fano varieties, and so on, but I have not included them in the body of the post so I could fit in the whole story without meandering too much.",math,Tazerenix,False,/r/math/comments/lnuqn6/resolution_of_the_finite_generation_conjecture/

While I was working out an algorithm to map any (x,y) value to a number in a square number spiral, going at it step by step, I've found a new trick and wondered if this is a normal thing used by mathematicians:

Mainly, I'm talking about artificially creating ""flags"" (0 or 1) values, to emulate IF / ELSE conditions, by taking advantage of the fact that 0\^x=0, 0\^0=1, x\^0=1 and multiplying by it to exclude (or include) parts of a formula. I'll try to make a very simple example, I'm not sure how I can describe the concept with words:

    if( a == b ):
    r = a + b
    else:
    r = a - b

Could be written as:

    f = 0 ^ abs( a - b )
    r = ( ( a + b ) * f ) + ( ( a - b ) * ( 0 ^ f ) )

Again, this is a very simplified example, it could be used for more complex conditions. It could also just be used to exclude a specific set of instructions in a parenthesis, depending on the flag.

While I'm sure that IF / ELSE situations are normally resolved differently, does this kind of methodology have a name or any uses?

Game Theory: Optimal strategy to win in 5×5 Tic-Tac-Toe,1613704782," So I made up this game, but I'm not able to find a good strategy to always win.

It's very similar to the original [3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Tic-Tac-Toe); but with a little change.

So you draw a 5×5 board. Then each player takes turns putting a cross and circle. We then count the ""scores"".

This is a [completed game](https://i.imgur.com/D38fYXT.png) that I drew. The scores are made by counting every 3-in-a-row strike. So for example in the top row, cross guy gets 1 point.

You then do the counting horizontally, vertically, and both ways diagonally; for each row, column and diagonal.

For a 4-in-a-row, you get two points, as you can look at it as 2 different 3-in-a-rows. Similarly, a 5-in-a-row would get 3 points.

In the example game, cross wins as it get 9 whereas circle gets only 7.

I play this a lot; but it's always hard to tell where to put your next move. I've noticed that starting first gives you a significant advantage. To compensate for this, I lower the points of the guy who started first by one.

This can obviously be extended to further dimensions, but I would like an answer only for a 5×5 grid.

So what's the optimal strategy?

The method used to construct the confidence interval either will or will not contain μ so it is not correct say that there is a 95% chance of containing μ. Rather, I think it would fair to say that if one where to construct 100 confidence intervals for μ, we can expect 95 of them to contain μ.

Proof that ∞ - ∞ = -∞,1613697108,"Infinity doesn't equal Infinity, or 0.

Here is proof

∞ is equivalent to x/0, x being any positive integer.

Why are math textbooks so expensive?,1613696860,"I was reading the famous textbook on representation theory by Curtis and Reiner when I thought to myself, that I should buy this book and have a physical copy. It's from the 60's, the authors have died over 30 years ago, surely it shouldn't be that expensive or at least I thought. Well, it is (it costs 93 usd). 

According to random sources on the Internet, authors usually make less than 10% of the money in royalties, so why do (newly written) textbooks cost up to 140 usd anyways?

Math and ADHD/ADD,1613692212,"Quick background: I'm a PhD student who has always had a relatively easy time when it came to my math courses. I was able to cruise through my bachelor and masters without much studying, however, since starting my PhD I found that just doesn't cut it anymore. 

I'm trying to make a conscious effort to spend a good amount of time per day either studying or doing research (I try to aim for 4 hours a day minimum) but I've found this incredibly tough. I *want* to study but I just can't, I know it might sound ridiculous but I just find myself in these endless youtube or Wikipedia black holes. When I read a textbook or a paper I find get to end not knowing a thing about what I read and my mind is usually somewhere else, be it thinking about the weather or what I'm having for dinner. Same thing for lectures, be it in person or online (though online is definitely harder to stay focused). After some Google searching I kept seeing ADHD as a possible cause. Now the thing is I don't remember being like this when I was younger, in fact I used to be an avid reader. Nowadays I only can focus in these intense bursts, usually when it's something more engaging such as solving a problem or coding, especially if there is a deadline. But just doing assigned reading or listening to a lecture when I know it's recorded? Forget about it, even if I *want* to learn the material. 

I have made an appointment with my doctor to discuss this, but in the mean time, has anyone else experienced something similar especially in relation to math? I am wondering if this is just me making an excuse for being lazy, a result of my smartphone usage and such, or if it really is something such as ADHD.

Applying incomplete gamma function to an engineering problem - a question.,1613646390,"I have an engineering integration problem at my work which I solved using incomplete gamma function.

I can use existing numerical algorithms to find the values of gamma.

But the thing is that I also have to find a definite integral which is exp(x)*x^(a-1)*dx from x1 to x2 because I have both declining and growing stuff here (x is time). The exponent is now growing with x, and the gamma function does not seem to accommodate it. Does anyone have a clue how to tackle this other integral? Any ideas would be much appreciated.

Is my Discrete Structures class weird or am I a bad student?,1613597616,"I'm an adult student studying Math Education.  I was a gymnastics coach for 4 years and between USAG sex abuse scandals and covid ruining my employment opportunities, I decided to shift gears.  Math was always my best subject in high school.  So far of the college level math classes I've taken Trig and Calc 1 and got As.  Right now I'm in a Discrete Structures class and it's.... weird.

There is no book.  Our professor came up with a list of theorems, proofs, and examples that he's teaching from, that we all copy down in our notes every class.  It's a 3 credit hour class that meets once a week on Thursdays, and we're not always there for two hours even.  Concepts are introduced, questions are asked, and the class stares back blankly.  I know from my experience coaching that if I explain something and have a bunch of kids staring at me with no idea what to do, it's not because they're stupid, it's because I explained it poorly.  Homework is assigned that's due the next week and if you have questions about it you have to show up to his office hours to ask them.

I haven't really talked to any of my classmates very much, I'm the adult in a room full of kids so that's kinda weird.  But I'm getting the vibe that I'm not the only person who feels like I showed up to a Spanish class, got a Spanish-English dictionary thrown at my head, and told to speak Spanish.

I understand that some work is required on behalf of the students.  In my Calc class they would introduce concepts, but at least they would be explained more thoroughly and a few more examples given so you can get a general idea of how it works, before you're thrown to the homework to really figure it out.  I've had bad teachers before where I had to teach myself everything out of the book, but in this case there is no book!  I know so little about the concepts being described that I don't even know where to start Googling for lessons or answers half the time.

1) Is my class weird?  Should I talk to the Math Department?  I feel like I deserve the three hours a week of instruction that I've paid for, as well as a textbook.  I also feel like any math class meeting once a week is bad practice.  There needs to be back and forth on homework and questions with the homework before it's due.  Am I wrong?

Thought experiment in need of a little direction.,1613597536,"Hello everyone, I'm a pathology resident and wanted to work on a thought experiment if any of you are interested in helping.

Math within cross stitching,1613513203,"So, I’ve noticed something very interesting while I was cross stitching and was wondering if I was the only one that saw this pattern. I believe it is called an Euler tour, where you start from one point and are able to travel to every other point and return at the end. One example is any geometric shape, since you start and end at the same place, but also if there was any bisector of the shape, it would be impossible to end at the same part without crossing over the same place twice. So anyways, about cross stitching, you are trying to go to one end and reach the start, by going over the same path. Could this be some sort of variation of an Euler tour you are trying to find if you are able to cross each path twice? Also, there are some parts to cross stitching where you only go over one, so this would make the path more complicated to cross, which could be like if you had a mix between two-time lines and one-time lines, which I think is very interesting and almost like you could use math to draw a figure.",math,JandN7654321,False,/r/math/comments/llexvj/math_within_cross_stitching/
TIL commutativity of addition in a ring isn’t a needed axiom,1613511486,"Rings are always introduced as “an Abelian group with some extra structure”, but what’s interesting is that you can prove that a ring has commutative addition with the other axioms as follows:

= x + x +y + y
(1+1)(x+y) = 1(x+y)+1(x+y)
=x+y+x+y

What is the name of the theory behind this?,1613386586,"Hi, I'm not a math guy, but this is something that I discovered 12 years ago in high school.

Stack two had 004, 005, 006 and so forth.

In my time hanging out in the corridor, I noticed a trend. All lockers with the same digits no matter the order, were always on the same height across all stacks.

For example, locker 001 was the first, being at the top. Locker 010, and 100 were also at the top. 002, 020, 200 were in the middle. 003, 030, 300 on the bottom. Then 004, 040, 400 are on the top. I concluded that lockers 373, 337, 733, 3070 etc would all be in the same position, no matter what numbers I picked.

Functions whose derivatives are the terms of a predictable sequence.,1613379164,"Hello!

I've been recently intrigued by functions whose derivatives can be expressed as terms in a sequence. An obvious example would be the sine function using modulo:

f^((n))(x) = sin(x) if n mod 4 = 0, cos(x) if n mod 4 = 1, –sin(x) if n mod 4 = 2, or –cos(x) if n mod 4 = 3

Another, even more obvious example, is the exponential function:

f^((n))(x) = (ln(a))^(n) · a^(x)

Perhaps a less obvious example, though, is the logarithm function:

f^((n))(x) = ln(x) if n = 0, else (-1)^(n-1) · (n-1)! / (x+1)^(n)

A function that does not work to my knowledge is 1/√(1-x^(2)), as subsequent derivatives quickly explode into large terms as a consequence of the quotient rule.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is whether there are many more functions like these, or are they restricted to a small subset including the above? Some conditions for the functions I'm looking for include:

So yesterday, I asked myself ""is it possible to find a complex such that raising i to that value gives 2 as a result?"" And so went to my desk, grabbed a piece of paper and a pencil, and I got to work. Now, as we all know, this equation isn't very hard to solve, we can use Euler's Identity to find an answer, the result will simply be Ln(2)/Ln(i), and Ln(i) is equal to 0.5πi(1+4k) where k is a constant from the set of integers.

Great, we found a value that satisfies the equality, now, can we do something similar with 1?

Allow me to take the original expression (i^z=2) and square both sides, we end up with i^2z=4, or (-1)^z=4. Now, if we repeat the process, 1^z=16, but 1^n is always equal to 1, right? As far as I know, I haven't made any ilegal steps like dividing by 0. Why does this work? Remember, 1 can be written as a power of e, such that e^2kπi=1 for any value of k from the set of integers, right? Now, what happens if we raise 1 to the i? Substituting 1=e^2kπi, then we get (e^2kπi)^i, and after a bit of simplification, we get e^(-2kπ), a real number (as long as k is an integer, as previously stated). Now, if we substitute k=0, we get 1, but what if we substitute any other value of k? We get very different values for 1^i. 

Now, what if we raise 1^2.5? Well, spoiler alert, it's not 1 either. Using the same substitution used previously, (e^2kπi)^2.5 will give e^5kπi, which at k=1 will give a result of -1, and at k=0 will give a result of 1. So I propose 3 options:

a) 1^n=1 only wolds true for values of n inside the set of integers.

b) Math is broken, and it is possible to demo strate that any number n is equal to any other number m via a little algebra.

c) Euler's Identity Is a lie.

So, what do you think? Am I wrong? Is there something I'm ignoring?

Am I right that every map can be generated with this recursive process? (Not rigorously stated... very happy to clarify as needed if necessary.),1613327189,"Here's how it looks to me right now. Every map with a finite number of regions (each region of finite area) on a plane can be constructed by the following process:

Here are some definitions:

A boundary is a closed curve. (Both regions and maps have boundaries. A map is a contiguous collection of regions)

A ""Periphery Map"" with boundary B is a map in which:

* every region's boundary contains exactly one segment which is also a segment of B, and
* Every point in B  is also a point on one of those segments.
* (Intuitively: an archetypical example of a periphery map would be the map consisting just of the contiguous US states which border on Canada, Mexico, or an ocean. In other words, a periphery map is a map which can serve as the set of ""outmost regions"" of some other map)

A ""Spoke Region"" with boundary B as its anchor is a single region whose own boundary contains at least two non-contiguous segments which are also segments of B. 

* (Intuitively: A ""Spoke Region"" is like the spokes of a wheel all thought of as a single region, with B being the wheel and the spokes being a region touching the wheel at several places.)

With the above definitions, here's the construction:

1. Draw an outer boundary. Call the boundary B.
2. Draw a periphery map with B as its outer border, OR draw a spoke region with B as its anchor. (Note that now either the region inside B is completely filled, or else there remain one or more empty regions within B.) 
3. If you have constructed your target map, END. Otherwise, choose an area inside your current map\* which has not yet had any regions constructed in it. Call its boundary B. Return to step 2.

\*Important: Inside your current entire map, NOT just inside your current boundary B.

Can you find an example of a map (finite number of finite regions) on a plane which can't be constructed by the above process?

Is this a Nash equilibrium?,1613289440,"I apologize if this is a known problem in game theory, but some cursory Google searches didn't contain any answers, and my only knowledge in game theory comes from one random CS class I took 5 years ago.

There's a game that I wrote some code to play. It's a standard symmetric, two-player, non-zero-sum game, with a move-space of around 1e50 moves. A property of this specific game is that it's efficient to, given a distribution over moves, compute the move that results in the best expected evaluation against this distribution. So, my algorithm does the following to choose a move:

1) Start with a singleton corpus of an arbitrary state.

2) Choose the move that performs best against the corpus, and add it to the corpus. If there is a tie, choose one arbitrarily.

3) Repeat (2) n times.

4) Sample this corpus, and output this result.

My question is, does this eventually converge to an equilibrium? Rigorously, is it true that for every epsilon &gt; 0, there is  some N such that for all n &gt; N, an individual's advantage for deviating from sampling the corpus (given that they know their opponent is sampling the corpus) is less than epsilon?

Intuitively this seems true, and empirically, my strategy has been working well. But I'm struggling with rigorously proving this. This seems like the obvious algorithm one would employ to come up with a decent solution for this sort of game, so I'm curious if there's existing literature that discusses this. Or, if not, if people smarter than me can directly prove or disprove this.

To be clear, this question is entirely theoretical, rather than practical. I'm aware that, in pathological cases, it's possible for this algorithm to result in a distribution that includes every move in the move-space.",math,purpleappletrees,False,/r/math/comments/ljkbr6/is_this_a_nash_equilibrium/

The way I found this formula was, I was thinking to myself the other day about compound interest, and I was trying to calculate how much will I have at the end of the year if I invest $1 000 every month with a interest rate of 1% (considering I invest the first a thousand at january 31st and the last at December 31st, and stop counting at january 1st). The answer isn't 12 000*1.01^12, because that would be if I had 12 thousand at the beggining of the year, which I don't. So I found that, the first 1 000 would generate interest for 11 months, the second would generate for 10 months and so on, and the last would have no interest, so if I add up all of these individual values I will have my answer. I figured this was a inefficient way of solving it, so I realized that, if I had 100k at the beggining of the year, I would be generating a passive income of 1 000, and if I reinvest all that money every month, I will have gained exactly the same amount of money as if was investing 1 000 every month from my own salary, so I can just tipe into my calculator 100 000×1.01^12 and remove the 100 000 and that will be my answer. So I just replaced the numbers with letters and found a general formula.",math,DaviCB,False,/r/math/comments/ljfhyn/i_found_a_formula_that_i_can_only_proove_through/

Knowing all the math but 0 mathemathical insight,1613250970,"How do I develop mathemathical insight in a reasonable timeframe?  


I learned all of the math that I have to learn in record time. I memorized all the rules and did my best to memorize the logic. Yet when it comes to exam practice questions. I still flunked the exam, I scored a 3. I've been doing practice questions, but I do selfstudy, so despite learning everything, the questions I make are specifically related to topics and how to apply the rules. Test and exam stuff is a different league. Practice questions are like, ''show us how to make this dish with these ingredients.'' Were as exam stuff is like; ''Find out what dish this person wants based on this questionnaire, then get all the ingredients you need from the grocer and find a good kitchen to make it in, have fun.'' This type of thinking works for me outside of math. My neurons are wired for biology.  


I actually got placed for biomed and medicine, which I will be doing next year. I'm just a mathematical insight retard. How do I fix that? Applying the math is easy but knowing what to apply on a question is nearly impossible for me. Or well, its hard enough that I do not actually complete enough successfully in order to score well. I struggled with mathematical logic super hard as a kid and hated it more then anything, fractions were worse then my alcoholic dad. (They still suck to think about but I can actually do them fully now) Its easier as an adult, but after that flunk, I just want this to get over with so I can actually do stuff I love and doesn't give me severe anxiety attacks weeks before the exam.  


But I have to get this torture over with, so I do not get cockblocked from my positive future by a bunch of numbers. I am so glad I do not have to use mathemathical insight in biomedical sciences.

Is there a proof that the sum of two arbitrary roots of primes is irrational?,1613169086,"I recently worked through the proof that the sum of the square roots of two primes is irrational, and decided to try to generalize this to arbitrary roots of primes.

How much math is an incoming undergrad expected to know?,1613087844,"   Hello. I'm a junior in high school, and I'm worried that I won't be ready for undergrad math.

It seems most incoming math undergrads have already learned these subjects fully and then do research as a freshman, or that, in other words, one needs to know all of undergrad math before becoming an undergrad.

Recently I've been thinking about spaces wherein each region is an approximate map of the whole space - I just want to explain it to somebody and get feedback. :),1613083734,"I've lately been considering an idea about a special kind of lattice (representing the lattice of open sets of a topological space, perhaps? my grasp of topology is fuzzy) in which the principal ideal of each element in a sense ""maps"" or models the entire lattice.

Start with a lattice L. For each element A of L, add a homomorphism from L to the principal ideal generated by A. Call the element that B is taken to by this homomorphism ""AB"". We can think of this as ""A's map of B"", or ""the most B-like part of A"", or perhaps even ""the part of A closest to B"" - defining a ""mapping"" operation. Because this is based on homomorphisms, it also automatically follows that A(B+C) = AB+AC (with + as join in the lattice - the same goes for meet). This makes intuitive sense if you think of it in words as ""A's map of the union of B and C is the union of A's map of B and A's map of C"".

I don't think the other kind of distributivity holds, though - it is not obvious to me that (A+B)C = AC+BC, as the most C-like part of the union of A and B may be outside either of them, if the smallest region containing both also has other regions in it. And basing all this on homomorphisms to principal ideals seems to provide the former but not the latter kind, anyway, so it fits.

I'm particularly interested in ways of choosing all these homomorphisms so that this mapping operation is a semigroup - that is, it has (AB)C = A(BC). I don't have a perfect argument as to why it ought to be so, other than ""wouldn't it be cool if this made a near-semiring with join / meet?"", but it feels to me like ""(A's map of B)'s map of C"" ought to be the same as ""A's map of (B's map of C)"". I can see it in my head as a sort of overlap between two different ways of projecting the entire space down into a part of itself - which is where I got the idea of using homomorphisms to principal ideals in the first place - but I can't quite see what extra requirements on this process would guarantee it other than just asking for associativity in the final mapping operation by fiat. I feel like there's something very obvious I'm missing on that front.

Other facts: this operation need not be idempotent, and indeed there are simple examples of it on small lattices which are not. A region's map of itself need not be isomorphic to itself. If we replace ""region"" with ""person"" and ""map"" with ""mental model"", it makes sense that your mental model of yourself is not guaranteed to be perfectly accurate! And again, with this interpretation, it seems to me that (Alice's model of Bob)'s model of Clara = Alice's model of (Bob's model of Clara). (This is the original inspiration for the concept, in fact, before I realized that it extended naturally to spaces.)

The operation also does not need to have any identities, on either side, but if it has a two-sided identity, then that is always the top element of the lattice. Similarly, it need not have any two-sided zeroes, but if it does, then that is the bottom element of the lattice.

I have tried out various other similar operations and tried to see ways to fit them together - for instance, there is a natural dual which uses homomorphisms to filters rather than to ideals - but so far nothing has stuck, although I keep noticing patterns that remind me of skew lattices.

The reason I made this post is basically because I need to word vomit everything I'm thinking in an organized way and see if anyone knows of similar constructions, has ideas about what I ought to investigate, what I might want to try proving about these structures, and why I have this niggling intuition that the mapping operation MUST be associative despite it not technically being inevitable.",math,Electronic_Purple_80,False,/r/math/comments/lhx2sm/recently_ive_been_thinking_about_spaces_wherein/

Why are robust completion problems more difficult?,1613055625,"Suppose you had a data matrix with unobserved entries and would like to recover the missing entries. This is an underdetermined problem and cannot be solved unless you regularize this problem. Hence a common regularization is to assume that the data matrix is low rank. Now it often isn't so easy to just assume low rankness because the rank functional is nonconvex but let's not get into that as it isn't the core of my question. This problem is known as the matrix completion problem and has been shown to be solvable by convex optimization by Candes' and his boys. Essentially they demonstrate that so long as the unobserved entries are randomly spread out (Bernoulli model) and the matrices left singular vectors and right singular vectors are not too parallel with one another (also neither the left nor right singular vectors are too parallel with the standard basis vectors) then recovery is possible, this condition is referred to as incoherence. This is basically the 2-D analog of compressed sensing if you know what that is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now there is a different problem from matrix completion that is highly related ...

For context, recall that principal component analysis (PCA) minimizes the L2 norm which is known to be sensitive to outliers. Robust statistics is a field of mathematics that seeks to make existing statistical methods, such as PCA, more resilient to noise and outliers. Now the idealized robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is an optimization algorithm that seeks to decompose a data matrix M with grossly corrupted sparse noise into the superposition of two matrices of the same size, M = L + S. Here L is a low-rank matrix, which is often interpreted as the underlying signal, and S is a sparse matrix, which is often interpreted as sparse anomalies in the signal (sometimes noise but not always). Candes' and his boys showed that exact separation was possible given similar incoherence conditions of L and also that the support of S is randomly spread out. In addition L needs to be sufficiently low rank and S needs to be sufficiently sparse.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Here is my question: Why does it seem like performing both of these tasks at once is so difficult? For instance you could call this problem a robust matrix completion problem. It seems the analysis of this scenario is much more difficult and was wondering if someone could explain to me what makes this so difficult.",math,algebruhhhh,False,/r/math/comments/lhmfmy/why_are_robust_completion_problems_more_difficult/

The problem is, people have looked at some 3D slices of that 4D set and... well, they don't look very interesting.

I hypothesize that this is more about our inability to _see_ the thing, rather than that there isn't any interesting structure going on there. I said people have looked at 3D slices of a 4D set, but actually, they're looking at a 2D projection of a 3D slice of a 4D set (since we're looking at them on 2D screens). It seems likely that something might be lost in translation.

This made me wonder: if I were a 2 dimensional being, looking at a 1 dimensional screen, is there a way I could appreciate the beauty of the Mandelbrot set? 

You could try looking at a sequence of 1D slices, the way we'd look at an MRI, but it spirals so much through the second dimension that I doubt you'd be able to make any sense of it. You could make a program to give you a ""first person"" interactive view of what it would be like to walk around inside or outside the set, but you'd only be able to see the boundary; all that lovely structure about how _quickly_ the point escapes would be lost.

Metric for string periodicity (or repetitive-ness)?,1613047663,"Hello! I am looking for a way to get a rough measure for string quasi-periodicity, for use in a real-time generative application. The strings I'm working with likely do not need to be very long (a few thousand tokens at the \*absolute\* maximum, but it is more likely I'll be working with strings between 30-80 tokens long).

Something akin to a Fourier Transform that works on strings of tokens would be absolutely perfect. Beyond that-- I am looking for some metrics (or algorithm to find a metric) to judge quasi-periodicity or quasi-repetition of a string.

I've been reading a lot of papers on string combinatorics/ string processing algorithms, but it is very difficult to know what I want to be reading about without good search terms.

I would really appreciate people's input either on:

* metrics,
* packages (in java or c (or for Max/MSP)) to use for string processing,
* papers/books/vidoes/etc. to read on this subject, or
* search terms, which might help me better find what I am looking for.

Hello guys Im confused,1613047524,"Im trying to figure out the following, excuse any form of wrong speaking or expressing myself 

&amp;#x200B;

If I have an asset A, lets say Apples.

Day one of the month I buy an apple for X amount

I can go to the market and sell it for a profit, so X gives me Y amount

&amp;#x200B;

I can hold this apples and they might become golden apples, after T amount of time, being now 100x , or they could rot anytime, being (0\*X)

&amp;#x200B;

Or I can keep going to the market to make a profit, in a percentage of X, X%

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that it said if an asset returns you X%, then 72/x% gives you the amount of cycles, you need to double 

so, 5% for example, needs 72/5 = 14,4 visits to the market

&amp;#x200B;

Questions:

Q1: Should I apply a decission tree being 

\- 0x

\- ?x

\-100x

to decide how many ?x is worth it to go to the %x path of going to the market?

&amp;#x200B;

Q2: What %X is needed to make 100x in less T (time)?

&amp;#x200B;

estimates: 

\- golden apple 100x takes 5 years for example

\- you can go every day to the market, multiple times

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\------

thoughts: (correct me if Im wrong)

my assumption: to make 100x you need to double x 6-7 times?

optimal guessing strategy,1613013958,"Suppose you're guessing an integer in a range - say 1 to 100. After each guess you're told wether you are correct, low or high. The goal is to guess the integer as quickly as possible.

My question is, does anyone know what the hell I am remembering, and in what way (if at all) is it superior to a binary search? 

Also, if I know someone else is using the binary search strategy, can I then come up with a strategy that will be better (even with a worse expected value, win by a little 51% of the time, lose by a lot 49% of the time, for example)?

Tried to write an interesting blurring algorithm and got this instead!,1613011673,"https://i.redd.it/y96ssqbeirg61.gif

The program moves a 3x3 window along the image and with each pixel containing an (R,G,B) tuple, the program gets the average (euclidean) distance, d\_avg, of the surrounding 8 points in the window with respect to the center point in the window. 

It then gets the average angle, a\_avg, the 8 points (as vectors) makes with the center point (as a vector). Then the program collects all those (R,G,B) values which are a distance of d\_avg away from the center point (think of this as making a sphere in R\^3 whose center is the point with coordinates given by the (R,G,B) tuple of the point in the center of the 3x3 window) and have an angle of a\_avg from the center point.

 The set of tuples satisfying both the distance and angle condition essentially forms a great circle on the sphere  around the center point. From there a tuple is selected at random from that circle and all of the 9 pixels in the current window are set to that chosen (R,G,B) value.

The gif contains 21 iterations of this program. Something worth noting is that since the window starts at the top left and ends at the bottom right, I suspect that is the reason why the figure is migrating towards the top left.

Number of unique up to isomorphism meet semilattices of size k which are embeddable in a Boolean lattice as a lower closed subset?,1613010483,"Playing around with free distributive lattices, Dedekind numbers and whatnot I ran into an interesting sequence that I can find no information about.

Let *k* be a natural number. 

Let *B* be a Boolean lattice such that |*B*| = 2*^(k)*.

* Works to think of it as the power set of some set *X* of size *k*
* Technically works for any |*B*| ≥ 2*^(k-1)*, but |*B*| = 2*^(k)* is easier to think about

Let *lcs*(*B*,*k*) be the set of lower-closed subsets of *B* of size *k*.

* The set of subsets *S* of *B* such that |*S*| = *k* and for all *x*  ∈ *S* if there is a *y* ∈ *B* such that *x* ≽ *y*, then *y* ∈ *S*
* *lcs*(*B*,*k*) = {*S* ⊆ *B* :  |*S*|= *k* ∧ ∀*x*,*y* ∈ *B*\[x ∈ *S* ∧ *x* ≽ *y*  → *y* ∈ *S*\]}

The set *lcs*(*B*,*k*) is a collection of meet semilattices. The sequence in question arises from counting the isomorphism classes in *lcs*(*B*,*k*) when |*B*| = 2*^(k)* (or more generally |*B*| ≥ 2*^(k-1)*). 

Working this out for *k* from 1 to 8 we get the sequence 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 7. Let *A*(*k*) denote the *k*th term in this sequence, illustrated below. The ordering by embeddability is interesting too so I included an illustration of it.

General direction to take when trying to know math,1612986645,"Hello friends!

I am currently studying for my master's degree in the subject of data science and during that time, as well as my undergraduate studies, I was exposed to the wonderful world of mathematics. I studied the theoretical foundations of computer science such as set theory, discrete mathematics, mathematical logic, and such. I had courses on linear algebra and analytic geometry and calculus. Even though maths isn't the main area of my expertise, I have grown quite familiar with the general concept of maths as an analytical tool to explain the world. There lies my insecurity around the subject. Most of my understanding is on a very intuitive level, in the sense that I really don't have the necessary skill to do proofs, but I have a general understanding of how concepts of measure theory relate to probability, which in turn relates to statistics, which in turn relates to data science. At 14 I measured an IQ of 140, whose growth I may have substantially stunted with substance abuse during my undergrad studies. Even tho this is the case, I seem to have developed strong skills in high-level abstraction and analytical thinking.

I would love to deepen my understanding of maths to the point that I can freely and fluently read any mathematical notation and/or scientific paper without having to go through the rabbit hole of learning about concepts through rigorous online browsing of neverending references. I suppose it is impossible to know all of the current math, but I would love to be able to draw general conclusions from research papers without having to spend hours trying to figure out what some concepts mean.

My question to you guys is:   
What would be the most beneficial fields of math to study to get a deep understanding of basic concepts that are broadly applicable in various other fields and what literature would you recommend?

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?
**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

A Simple Introduction to 4-Manifold Topology and Gauge Theory,1612846152,"I love gauge theory and its applications to 4-dimensional topology. I just think it's the neatest thing. Unfortunately, I've had trouble finding explanations that are accessible to an undergraduate audience; they all assume familiarity with differential geometry and algebraic topology. So I've decided to write one. I hope you all enjoy!

For this writeup, I'm going to assume basic familiarity with the notion of a manifold, at least intuitively. The introduction to the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold) should be sufficient. I'm going to assume some multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and group theory, and some general mathematical maturity as well, though this should be a fairly heuristic discussion so in depth knowledge won't really be needed.

For our purposes, there are two types of manifolds: continuous and smooth. This is the same as the difference between a continuous and a smooth function. Specifically, a manifold is defined via local continuous bijections to Euclidean space; for a smooth manifold, we require these bijections be smooth (aka infinitely differentiable). I won't go into the details here. As an example, the surface of a sphere is a smooth manifold, but the surface of a cube is not due to its corners.

We're doing topology, so we're considering two manifolds ""the same"" if you can deform one into the other without stretching or gluing. The gif on [this](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy) wikipedia page should give some intuition (though we will not be considering homotopy here). Specifically, two continuous (resp. smooth) manifolds will be called *homeomorphic* (rest. *diffeomorphic*) if there is a continuous (resp. smooth) bijection between them such that its inverse is also continuous (resp. smooth). The bijections are called *homeomorphisms* and *diffeomorphisms*, respectively. (This is essentially analogous to isomorphisms in linear algebra and group theory being ""bijections that preserve the structure"".)

So every smooth manifold is also a continuous manifold. So here's a question: *if two smooth manifolds are homeomorphic, are they diffeomorphic?* Intuitively: if you can stretch and squish one manifold into another, can you do it in a way that doesn't create creases or corners?

It's hard to visualize a situation where this is not true. Here's one reason: for 1-, 2-, and 3-manifolds, the answer is yes: homeomorphisms and diffeomorphisms are ""the same."" If two manifolds are homeomorphic they are diffeomorphic.

If a manifold N is homeomorphic to a manifold M but not diffeomorphic to M, then we say N is an *exotic M* or that is has an exotic *smooth structure*. So in 1, 2, and 3 dimensions, every continuous manifold has a unique smooth structure.

In dimensions 5 and up, this is not true. Some manifolds have nonunique smooth structures. (Some don't have smooth structures at all!) For example, the 7-sphere has [28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere#Classification) smooth structures. So we can count them! In fact, all manifolds in dimensions 5+ have finitely many smooth structures. The Euclidean spaces R\^n all have a unique smooth structure. The main tool we use for this is called the h-cobordism theorem. This is a powerful tool for proving when two manifolds are diffeomorphic, and it allows us to count smooth structures. (Additional fun fact: the set of smooth structures on a sphere forms a group!)

In 4 dimensions, the h-cobordism theorem fails. Is dimension 4 ""more like"" dimensions 1, 2, and 3, or 5+? For a long time, we knew next to nothing. Then, in the 80s and 90s, a new tool called gauge theory emerged. This allowed us to answer some basic questions. At first, it looked like 4 dimensions was gonna be like 5+ dimensions: works of Simon Donaldson and Michael Freedman shows that there were manifolds with no smooth structure in dimension 4, and manifolds with multiple smooth structures. But the situation turns out to be much, much wilder than that.

First, Cliff Taubes showed that R\^4 has *uncountably many smooth structures*. Then more results came in, showing various different classes of manifolds had countably or uncountably infinitely many smooth structures.

To date, no one has showed the existence of a 4-manifold with a unique smooth structure.

To date, no one has showed the existence of a 4-manifold with **finitely many** smooth structures.

And the sphere S\^4? We have no idea. We suspect it has multiple smooth structures but all our techniques so far have failed for it (the reason why, for those who know algebraic topology: many of our techniques fundamentally live in the second homology of a manifold, and require that the second homology be sufficiently large for them to work. The sphere has trivial second homology.)

Okay, so what's gauge theory and how can it answer some of these questions? Well, first we have to introduce the notion of an invariant.

Question: Is the sphere homeomorphic to the torus (the surface of a donut)?

If you said no, you're right. Why? Well, you may have said ""because the donut has a hole and the sphere doesn't."" So the number of ""holes"" a manifold has is an example of an *invariant*, that is, a property that doesn't change under homeo/diffeomorphism. This invariant is the genus. The sphere has genus 0, the torus has genus 1, so therefore they're not homeomorphic.

Now, if two manifolds are homeomorphic, they have the same genus. So the genus is too ""coarse"" of an invariant to detect smoothness, since if two manifolds are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic they'll have the same genus. What was needed for a long time was an invariant that contained information about the smooth structure. Gauge theory provided the answer.

Gauge theory is actually a broad framework which contains many different theories. I'll be focusing on the current state-of-the-art for these types of questions: Seiberg-Witten Theory. This theory emerged in physics, where gauge theory is used to describe fields in quantum field theory that are invariant under ""gauge transformations,"" i.e. infinitesimal actions by a certain group, the *gauge group*. But it turned out to have topological applications.

Seiberg-Witten theory starts with a set of differential equations defined on your smooth (and compact) 4-manifold M. The solutions to these equations aren't functions, or even vector fields; they're a more general notion of vector fields and even tensor calculus called ""sections of a principal bundle."" (Specifically, a solution contains a section of a bundle and a connection, i.e. a differential operator, on that bundle.) I won't go into the details of what these are, but suffice to say they're difficult, and a generalization of vector fields that allows for more specific ""twisting.""

Now we don't just look at single solutions, we look at the space of all solutions. Now, because this is gauge theory, the action of our gauge group will take solutions to solutions, so we can ""quotient"" this space by the gauge group (i.e, call two solutions ""the same"" if the gauge group takes one to the other) and look at the space we get, with the help fo some very difficult analysis and high powered machinery including the famous Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem. 

This is a very general procedure, used in a number of different situations such as Yang-Mills theory, pseudoholomorphic curves, Higgs bundles, etc. In our case, we get a ""moduli space"" X of solutions. In this particular case of the Seiberg-Witten equations, *X turns out to be a smooth, compact manifold.* Moreover, the standard topological invariants of X turn out to be *smooth* invariants of M. So if you can compute the Seiberg-Witten invariants (which is often hard, but doable!), you have an invariant which will detect structures. (Sidenote: many of the flashy results come from careful analysis of X, as opposed to ""just"" looking at the numerical invariants.)

These techniques, developed in the 90s, are still state-of-the-art. We've developed novel ways to use them (such as the ""Seiberg-Witten invariants of families"") but as of now they're just about all we have, and there are still many, many questions which remain unanswered.

MC Sampling for Integrals-Why not taught more?,1612845791,"I am from stats and was looking into how MCMC works for Bayesian methods but then I read that the Monte Carlo sampling half of it can even be used for typical integrals. This was mindblowing for me and the only thing I could think is “Why isn’t this taught like way back in HS AP calc, this is crazy” 

Basically when you have the integral of f(x) from a to b, you can sample from x~Unif(a,b), transform it with f(x) and simply take the sample mean and boom there is the approximate answer. 

It seems so simple and even simpler than typical numerical integration methods you learn like Trapezoid method, Simpsons Rule, etc where you are forced to think “more geometrically”. Taking a mean is easy. 

Especially those methods get even harder in Multivariate Calc when it becomes hard to visualize the geometry or set up the linear algebra matrix form of the integral.

Numbers whose powers are almost integers,1612425376,"Here's a question that just occurred to me. I suspect that a complete answer might be difficult, but maybe I'm wrong!

Consider the powers of the golden ratio φ = (1+sqrt(5))/2:

φ\^1 = 1.618

φ\^2 = 2.618

...

φ\^8 = 46.979

φ\^9 = 76.013

...

φ\^15 = 1364.0007

φ\^16 = 2206.9996

As the power n increases, φ\^n gets closer and closer to an integer value.

The same thing is true for various other numbers. For example, if a = 1+sqrt(3) then:

a\^1 = 2.73

a\^2 = 7.46

...

a\^8 = 3103.92

a\^9 = 8480.06

...

a\^15 = 3526400.009

a\^16 = 9634303.993

In both cases the reason is the same. Define the conjugate of φ to be φ\* = (1-sqrt(5))/2, and the conjugate of a to be a\* = 1-sqrt(3). Then it can be shown that φ\^n + (φ\*)\^n is always an integer, and similarly a\^n + (a\*)\^n is always an integer. Since |φ\*| &lt; 1 and |a\*| &lt; 1, this means that φ\^n and a\^n get closer and closer to integer values as n increases.

This argument works for any [quadratic integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_integer) whose conjugate has absolute value less than 1.

Nonlinear dynamics / chaos applications in social or behavioral sciences,1612389334,"When I graduated from my undergraduate program, I was burned out on math. I fell out of love with writing proofs and solving problem sets when I somewhat arbitrarily took a course on nonlinear dynamical equations. I fell in love with chaos!

I'm toying around with the idea of going back to study applications of chaos to subjects of behavioral or social sciences. In particular, I have some ideas about applying those ideas to voting behavior. I've been out of academia for a long time, so I'm out of touch with good resources for looking up published research at the intersection of my interests.

A brief survey of the intersection of algebraic and geometric topology,1612385039,"The point of this post is to get more people interested in the type of geometric topology I study, so if I say something that interests you, then please talk a little bit about your background and I can recommend some notes/books/papers. This is an expansion of a comment I recently wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

Of fundamental interest in geometric topology is the manifold. Topological, smooth, or other flavors, we hope to understand the structure of these manifolds, the information they contain, and their relation to each other. Undeniably one of the strongest tools in geometric topology is that of the fiber bundle. The existence of nontrivial bundles is something surprising to almost anyone who learns about manifolds, and it is one of the easiest examples of a fundamental idea in manifold theory that there are things that happen globally that cannot be detected locally.

For convenience, I know restrict to smooth manifolds: At its core, geometric topology is about understanding diffeomorphism types of manifolds. The biggest problems have been about this: the Poincare conjecture, s-cobordism theorem, etc. One might be surprised to learn that homotopy theory is able to say much about manifolds aside from their homotopy type. Again bundles are at the heart of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Bundles are associated to classifying spaces: spaces which have some type of all encompassing fiber bundle over them that all other fiber bundles derive from. In fact, the isomorphism type of the bundle is dictated by homotopy classes of maps into the classifying space. So we see that geometric information is not destroyed by invoking homotopical tools. Hopefully this has given a decent amount of motivation for the following problem:

How can we understand the classifying space of M fiber bundles, from now on BDiff(M)? There are two somewhat distinct ways we can describe a space: we can tell you the structure of its homotopy and (co)homology or we can give you certain models that are easier to work with (maybe we can construct maps in and out of them). I will use words like ""computational"" to refer to the first and ""homotopy type"" to refer to the latter.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind, there are 3 main ways each with advantages and disadvantages:

&amp;#x200B;

Waldhausen A theory:

This approach is incredibly wild. Essentially you come up with all types of categories, infinity categories, spectra, etc associated to your space and try to determine what information they contain about your original manifold. This theory has two advantages: the objects are designed to have plenty of maps between each other (these are good representatives of their homotopy types). It is easy to come up with functors between categories and so these lead to maps between spaces derived from these categories. As well, it is possible to do some calculation. This is put in a framework where all the tools of homotopy theory are at your disposal and additionally, there are also a lot of maps to discrete analogs. For example, the K-theory of the sphere spectrum maps to the K-theory of the integers, so we can study this map. At the end of the day, the key fact used to relate all of this theory to BDiff(M) is called Igusa stability. It says that up to a range increasing with the dimension of M, we can use these objects to study BDiff(M).

Outside of this range, this approach has been shown to fail. For the disk, all the rational information possible has already been obtained from these methods. This is the disadvantage.

Cobordism categories:

This approach takes a lot of the good of A theory while trying not to stray from our geometric home. There are many types of cobordism categories, and at the end of the day they are all trying to model some type of moduli space of submanifolds. If we are able to understand the homotopy type of this moduli space of submanifolds, we can then use it to study the object and morphism spaces of our cobordism category. If you have arranged your category correctly, one of these spaces is something you are interested in, and hopefully you have related it to your moduli space.

In my opinion, this approach is much easier to work with and when it works, it is incredibly strong. It gives us a good understanding of the homotopy type, and often we can use fancy techniques to do computations of (co)homology based off of it. The downside is that this is very specific and not super easily adaptable. It also usually requires some type of stability to do computations.

&amp;#x200B;

Configuration spaces:

Let me generalize our earlier problem, suppose instead of caring about diffeomorphism spaces we instead want to understand invariants and homotopy types of the spaces of embeddings between M and N (Emb(M,N)). Homotopy destroys embeddings, so we cannot directly apply homotopies and the like to embeddings. Instead we try to understand the homotopy of the induced map on configuration spaces.

To be precise, an embedding M -&gt;N induces a map on configurations of points in M to configurations of points in N. There is additional structure that is not so obvious, (sweeping some stuff under the rug) configurations of points are homotopy equivalent to configurations of small disks. Given a configuration of k little disks in a big disk AND a configuration of n disks in M, we may choose a disk in M and insert our first configuration of several little disks to get a new configuration of n+k-1 disks in M. This is saying the M is a right module over the little disks operad.

Embeddings also preserve this structure, so an embedding gives a map on configuration spaces that is a map of modules over the little disks operad. Now what if instead of studying Emb(M,N), I try to study Hom(config(M),config(N)) and ask how the map Emb(M,N) -&gt; Hom(config(M),config(N)) is to being a homotopy equivalence. The latter space can be attacked through means of homotopy theory. In fact, if dim N - dim M &gt;2, this map is an equivalence.

A marked advantage of this approach is that for almost all dimensions we have an equivalence that is true for all manifolds. However, a marked disadvantage is that this map is not generally an equivalence for Emb(M,M) i.e. Diff(M), so it cannot be directly applied to the study of the diffeomorphism groups.

Are constraints by dimensional analysis (a la physics) on closed form roots of algebraic equations also implied by Galois theory ?,1612379024,"In physics we have the concept of dimensional analysis: you can't add things of different dimensions/units but you can multiply or divide them. Also if the dimensions implied by your formula are different than the dimensions of the thing your formula is predicting, then your formula is probably wrong. 

So you can tell some formulas are immediately wrong even without knowing the physics of the situation. You dont' have to be Einstein to know that E = mc^2 + sqrt(c)  is wrong.

So I realized something similar applies to for example the formula for the roots of a quadratic equation. For simplicity lets assume a=1. Then we all know if  x^2 + bx + c =0, then 

x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4c))/2

If we pretend that 'x' is some physical quantity we care about, it has units. Then in x^2 + bx + c, it means that b must have same units as x (since bx must have same units as x^2) and c must have same units as x^2 .

So looking at  x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4c))/2  now make sense.

b^2 has units of x^2 . c has units of x^2. So b^2 - 4c make dimensional sense. The discriminant could not have been b^3 - 4c.

Going further sqrt(b^2 - ...) has dimensions of b. So -b +/- sqrt() makes dimensional sense and has units of b which are the same as units of x, which makes sense since this formula spits out x. So 
something like  sqrt(b) +/- sqrt(b^2.....) could be immediately flagged as a wrong formula without any proof effort. Similarly if the '2' in the denominator were replaced with 'c', that would be nonsense because  b/c has dimension of 1/x,  not x.

I have verified that the closed form solution for the reduced cubic 
x^3 + px + q=0 follows the same principle.

So is this something that is well-known and further is implied by the modern theory of algebraic equations (Galios solvability theory)?  I'm 99% sure it is, but never heard it mentioned.",math,cthulu0,False,/r/math/comments/lbvaa4/are_constraints_by_dimensional_analysis_a_la/

How to drop non-contributing colleague from a publication?,1612372520,"**Edit** Took a deep breath. Decided to let it go. I guess I just needed an avenue to vent, anonymously.

___________________

Currently in a team of 3. I'm the main author. But since it will be alphabetically arranged, it won't matter.

We have a colleague X who, to be fair, has attended all the meetings. However, he rarely contributes anything besides superficial comments. Or rewriting my proof/.tex in his own style, which according to him, is the ""industrial standard"".

I am unhappy with his effort. 

An anecdote (semi-rant)

&gt; X was tasked to prove a part. Which is not hard. Then, he TeX only his result without the proof. Assuming his result was correct, I went on with the bigger picture and in the end, my estimation was too rough. So I spent my birthday, Christmas and new year trying to find all kind of creatively way to get that estimate. No dice. 

&gt; That's when I suspected that this little ""supposed-to-be-not-so-hard"" part done by X is wrong. I proved it myself and sure enough I got a different result. And the rest of the proof sailed smoothly.

&gt; Between my search for answer, I have asked X, not once, not twice... but fucking 4 times to write down his proof so I can see what went wrong, and if I am indeed correct. I even offered him to just write on a paper, and if he is right, I will TeX it for him. But he has done zero. And my supervisor took his side, telling me that it is not that hard and X's answer should be correct.

&gt; Then, I have had enough. I wrote my proof down nice and neat in TeX, but still my supervisor rather believe X's result than mine. So when I rewrote my own proof in ""baby steps""-by-""baby steps"", as if it is for a high school student to read. Only then my supervisor ""believed"" me... He then conjured an explanation as to why X might have made that mistake, i.e. my own supervisor is making an excuse for X.  What the fucking fuck?

&gt; What my supervisor doesn't realized, however, is that X's mistake has cost me my holidays and almost my sanity. Not that I could do anything in a lockdown... but I could have done something else rather than stressing out for my research. 

&gt; And that is just one example. Since my proof is long and very tedious. My supervisor has tasked X to check my proof in details. And he has done none of that... how do I know that? Because I've set traps in my proof the night before meeting days, putting obvious typo/error in such a way that, if he caught it, that would highly suggests that he just started looking at my proof the night before. Which does not give him enough time to proofread and attend our morning meet. (I know, I am a sociopath.. but  I needed to test my hypothesis. I needed to know.)

&gt; And sure enough.....he fell into that, twice.... that or he just skimmed it.... even though he was specifically asked to read it in detail. 

&gt; I have not expressed my grievance to my supervisor. Because, deep down, I know have nothing to gain from this. I'm just going to just bite the bullet and admit that X is not here to share the workload. 

While I do not think he deserved to be on the list of authors (which, when alphabetically arranged, is front of me), I also do not want to burn the bridge. How does one deal with this? 

p.s. he just graduated and is on his early post-doc situation where every publication counts for his career. Which I understand, but hell... put some effort man.",math,advanced-DnD,False,/r/math/comments/lbsjvw/how_to_drop_noncontributing_colleague_from_a/

Can't make intuitive sense of the formal definition of homotopy equivalence,1612370813,"Hi everyone,

I feel like I have a pretty good intuitive idea of what homotopy equivalence is, meaning I am reasonably confident that if you show me two spaces, I will be able to tell you whether they are homotopy equivalent, according to my intuitive idea of what homotopy equivalence is.

On the other hand, I know the definition of two spaces being homotopy equivalent, and I understand well what the concepts that appear in it mean (i.e. continuous functions, homotopy between two maps).

What I don't get is how that definition relates to my intuitive idea of two spaces being equivalent. I would appreciate any help in understanding the motivation behind the definition, and visualizing what it means.

What I've tried:

* Coming up with a definition on my own (forgetting about the definition I know, but don't understand). I failed (I guess maybe this means I don't have as good an intuitive grasp on the concept than I think?) In particular, I can't come up with a definition that would make, say, a loop and a filled torus equivalent, but that would distinguish those spaces from a point.

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?
**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Summer research opportunities for a non-US student,1612282884,"Context: I have a Master's degree and I'll be attending grad school in the US in 2021. This academic year has been something of a mess and I haven't been able to do much mathematics.  I'd really like to find a math research opportunity over the summer. Since so much of the math community has moved online, I'm hopeful that I can find something.

The problem is, I don't know of summer math research programs that aren't just for American students/citizens. I also don't know of ones that aren't marketed as ""research for undergrads"", and I guess with a Master's degree it feels a little like cheating to try to get in on one of those. Apart from finding a professor willing to give up their summer and do research with me, do I have other options?

&amp;#x200B;

But that's why I wrote ""*(significant)* irrational numbers"".

Fixed-free bar pendulum frequencies can't be reconciled.,1612274717,"I wouldn't class this as a homework problem as it's being used at a PhD level and may (or may not) generate some interesting discussion).   
Trying to match theory with ANSYS FEA calculations of a simple pendulum frequency for a fixed-free bar system.

Bar 775um thick x 3.5 mm wide x 250 mm long (z, x, y axes respectively) with a 1kg point mass attached centrally to the bottom of the ribbon, so co-ordinates 0, -0.25, 0 (x,y,z). The model is fixed at (0,0,0) keypoint. The rest of the model is unconstrained and gravity is applied as 9.81 +Y-dir (this is correct for the modelling program).

&amp;#x200B;

![img](g7jhr9xbm2f61 ""An example of bending in soft z-direction with frequency 1.1 Hz.
"")

![img](r0g4sv5jm2f61 ""An example of bending in stiff x-direction with frequency 1.8 Hz.
"")

Youngs modulus of the bar, Y = 157e9 - we use isotropy here for simplicity - we assume the stiffness therefore only comes from geometrical thickness effect.

Second area moment I, = (a \* b\^3) / 12 where b thickness in direction of bending and a is perpendicular direction - this equations applies to a rectangular cross section.

We have 2, simplified theories. Interestingly, theory 1 works for bending in stiff, x-direction but not for z. Theory 2 works for soft, z-direction, but not for x. We are thinking there is some ""limit"" or aspect ratio here that determines the points where each equations validity fails but are unsure.

Other factors, tension, T = mg here, L length of the pendulum (our 250 mm length)

Can anyone make any suggestions?

Important realization about honey coiling and the Mandelbrot Set.,1612240219,"[I recommend that you watch this video before reading this post, because it might not make sense.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=zz5lGkDdk78)

I saw a video (by the popular YouTube channel Smarter Every Day) that describes how certain viscous flows in honey show patterns of stability when you hold them close to whatever container the liquid is dripping into. As you move farther away, the flow becomes random and there is no recognizable pattern. If you keep moving the dropper away (or whatever you’re letting the liquid flow out of), the flow becomes a stable and recognizable pattern again.

It sounds like the height of the dropper is really close to the variables that change in the logistic map that models the population of rabbits. (the bifurcation diagram of this equation is a linear single dimension of the Mandelbrot set)

Does this not seem like a reasonable assumption?

Why study Mathematics?,1612214385,"When I see this question answered I always hear things like ""to teach problem solving skills and logical reasoning"" but I've never really been satisfied with that answer.  Lots of fields can be said to teach problem solving skills and logic. I'm trying to workout a more precise characterization of why a person who doesn't plan to become a mathematician may still benefit from taking higher-level undergraduate mathematics courses. There are also the obvious fact that some professions demand they know some mathematics, like how engineers need to know calculus. When it comes to these what I'm trying to describe is what are some of the less obvious ways learning more math can help them. Like, how could an engineer benefit from taking abstract algebra? 

The way I see it, the main thing that distinguishes mathematics from other fields is the level of precision that we aim to obtain. For instance, lawyers also need to train in logical reasoning, but I believe that if a lawyer tried to apply the same level of precision to his arguments in law as mathematicians do in math, he wouldn't get very far. His arguments would be more pedantic than useful. So I think a good characterization of what math is good for needs to include this characteristic of precision. So I would say that math is useful  when 1. You need to be very precise 2. You have a lot of tiny details that you need to account for. 

I'll try to apply this line of reasoning to the example of programming. I hear often that math is useful for ""programming"" but I don't think that's true for most programmers. It depends on what you're programming. As I said, math is only really useful when there is a great need for precision and detail. If you're programming an application like a web browser, for example, I don't think math is that helpful. The overall functionality is what's important, not the precise details of how it works. Contrast this with something like compiler design. Programming languages have very precisely defined behavior and there are lot of little details that you need to keep track and take account of while designing a compiler. Network programming is another good example. You have all this data flying back and forth and you need to keep track of who has what , when and why.  This can be overwhelming if you don't approach the issue correctly. 

So when it comes to things that _are_ very precise, like compiler design and network programming, why should taking something like real analysis actually be beneficial?  The best way I can think to phrase it is, that ""math classes, particularly proof-based classes, teach you how to draw long, unbroken chains of logic from basic assumptions to complex, non-trivial conclusions"". This skill is very effective when applied to domains where your goals are very precisely defined and the complexity comes from needing to keep track of an overwhelming number of little details. 

To understand this, first you should compare and contrast the problems faced by a game developer vs a compiler designer. Say a game developer makes a game that works but discover at the end that the game just isn't very fun. What does he do? It's not as though they can pinpoint a specific point in the code that they need to change to suddenly make the game fun. 

But if a compiler designer makes a compiler only to find that a compiled ""hello world"" program actually outputs ""dlrow olleh"" then they should be expected to pin point the exact part of his code that is misbehaving. When he does this he engages in a very mathematical form of thinking. He essentially needs to keep track of how he expects each part of his code to function, and the assumptions he's relying on at every step of the process in order to trace back this incorrect behavior to its fundamental cause. This strongly parallels what mathematicians do when they try and prove theorems. 

So what do you think? I know I probably fumbled through some of the above reasoning so I'd really like to hear it if I said something that doesn't sound right to you. Also if anyone else wants to weigh in on how and why studying mathematics can be useful in other fields, please feel free to share.",math,Rioghasarig,False,/r/math/comments/laeh8r/why_study_mathematics/

Firstly would any reputable math journal accept such a proof knowing the proof comes form someone with little formal training in mathematics? Would it not be better for them to self publish like on a personal website and share it? What would be the down side of such a approach? 

And for a fun bonus question, if the motivation was to make money (it shouldn't be), how would they go about making money from such a proof?

Alexander Kuznetsov (algebraic geometer) has been arrested in Moscow for peacefully protesting the detention of Alexey Navalny. Petition asking for his release -- please share.,1612199205,"Hello everybody.

The mathematician and algebraic geometer Alexander Kuznetsov (Steklov &amp; HSE) has been arrested yesterday - together with his daughter -  for peacefully protesting the detention of Alexey Navalny.

Sasha Kuznetsov is one of the most influential algebraic geometers in the world. Also, is one of the kindest and nicest people to interact with.

Richard Thomas (Professor at Imperial College) has started a petition asking for his release. You can find the petition here: [https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/free-alexander-kuznetsov](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/free-alexander-kuznetsov)

Please consider to signing it and share the news.

EDIT:

* An update from the petition's website: ""Sasha's trial has been postponed until Wednesday; he has been released until then. His daughter has been released with a fine. Please continue to sign to express solidarity with all the mathematics students and members of the public who are also detained.""
* Update: another petition has been started asking for the release of the other maths students arrested. [https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/a-call-for-immediate-release-of-arrested-students](https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/a-call-for-immediate-release-of-arrested-students)

Loader.c (Loader's Number) growth rate?,1612193011,"[Loader's Number](https://googology.wikia.org/wiki/Loader%27s_number) is defined as D^5 (99) and i'm curious about what it's growth rate is. Googology wiki states that:

&gt; The program diagonalizes over the Huet-Coquand calculus of constructions, a particularly expressive lambda calculus. Its output, affectionately nicknamed Loader's number, is defined as D^5 (99)=D(D(D(D(D(99))))), where D(k) is an accumulation of all possible expressions provable within approximately log(k) inference steps in the calculus of constructions (encoding proofs as binary numbers and expressions as power towers). The proof strength and expressiveness of the calculus of constructions makes the output of D(k) grow very large for sufficiently large k.

&gt;David Moews has shown that D(99) is larger than 2↑↑30,419 (where ↑↑ is tetration), and that even D^2 (99) would be much larger than fε0+ω3(1,000,000) in the fast-growing hierarchy, using Cantor's definition of fundamental sequences. D^2 (99) thus is obviously much larger than the output of Marxen.c, which is upper bounded at the aforementioned fε0+ω3(1,000,000).

however, as you notice, 99 is still the base number used, so i'm wondering about how it grows with other numbers as the base number. you could even set up a table like this:

||D| D^2 | D^3 | D^4 | D^5
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:
1 |x|x|x|x|x

"Moving on from rejection from Grad school, how to proceed? (Not Career/Edu Advice)",1612160313,"There are some people I know who are currently already getting accepted to grad school and getting offers. I'm personally starting to get a little anxious since I haven't heard anything from any school I applied to. And well thinking about it... the reality is that it's actually possible to get rejected by all the schools I applied to. I remember months ago there someone who posted on here because that actually happened, even though he seemed to be a great student from Oxford.

I don't know, the thought has occurred to me that this could happen and probably will happen to some.. But after it happens what do people do? After the initial heartbreak and sadness, how do people move on without feeling like the last couple of years were a waste of time? (I say this because if rejection does happen, thoughts about regretting not having spent undergraduate differently will probably pop up). How long would the sadness last? How long will feeling like a failure because you might not have met your professors' expectations last? Should I try to pick up other hobbies? Would that actually help? 

Should I even keep doing math itself as a hobby? Or should I try to move on even from that? I know math is something one can keep doing because of its beauty and because there are so many notes and books avaiable. Heck, there are many topics in algebraic geometry and algebraic topolgy that interest me that I didn't get to see in undergrad. And because of how math is, it wouldn't be too difficult studying it on the side with others online.... but maybe doing that will give me thoughts of what could have been.

Lastly, what advice would you give to someone on telling their parents they didn't get in anywhere? That even after all the hours spent studying, and the money spent. It just didn't happen

(I know that because of the pandemic less people everywhere are going to get in, but even so.

I don't remember exactly, but I guess my question is, let's say you have N drawings, and you want to create as many cards as you can, where each card has k drawings and each two cards has exactly one in common. How many cards can you create and how?

Equivalence between linear algebraic and quadratic differentiation approach to least squares approximation?,1612035711,"It appears to me that the two should be equivalent, but there is no cross-reference between the relevant sections in my respective courses. 

I tried to prove a weak form of this equivalence by using 3 pairs of (x, y) values and a simple approximation function which goes as follows:  

β(0) + β(1)x = y

...where β(0) and β(1) are the coefficients I am looking for.

Effectively, I tried row reducing the following matrix to its Hermite form to gain a basis for the solution space of its transpose:

\[1 1 1

x(1) x(2) x(3)\]

Then I orthonormalized it. However, when summing the vectors of this orthonormal basis, each of them multiplied with their respective inner product with the y vector (the \[y(1), y(2), y(3)\] vector), in order to obtain the orthogonal projection of this y vector on the solution space of the transpose of the above matrix, I encountered some monsters of equations which inspire little confidence that they would eventually yield the desired result.

To be clear, by ""the quadratic differentiation approach to least squares approximation"" I mean taking the sum over all i of \[y(i) - β(0) - β(1)x(i)\]² and listing the partial derivatives of each β. This should yield what are called ""normal equations"", which when set to zero can be solved for the β vector which gives the closest approximation. 

I am aware that this equivalence can probably be shown rather easily by referring to abstract properties, but I would like, if possible, to see this demonstrated computationally. Could anyone point me to any mistakes in my reasoning, an alternative approach or perhaps some accessible literature on the matter which could show me how it's done? It would be much appreciated.

I've added some photos of my notes, in case they make any sense to anyone.

Having trouble with basic algebra,1612032944,"So im having the absolute worst time with algebra and math in general. A little bit of a backstory; So I dropped out of high-school when I was 17 and recently decided to get my GED now (just turned 26 yesterday) because I want better things in life. I got a 144 out of 145 on the practice test for the math portion and I guess I have A LOT to relearn. To be specific, im stuck right now on how to use the distributive property. I noticed that sometimes in the math problems the book provides me that when you use the distributive property, you switch up signs sometimes (addition switched with subtraction). WHY and WHEN do you know how to switch signs like that? An example i have is right here: -4(t-z). The solution is right here: -4t+4z. Why in the world did they switch the subtraction sign for the addition sign? When do you know how to do that and why?

The Poincaré Disk Model can be generalized to be embedded in Hyperbolic space and Spherical space in addition to the historical Euclidean space embedding,1612011925,"Thinking of The Poincaré Half-space Model of hyperbolic geometry gave me some insights into geometry.

The first main insight is that The Poincaré Half-plane Model is The Poincaré Disk Model zoomed-in infinitely far in on the ideal point at the bottom of the disk.

The second insight is that The n-dimensional Poincaré Half-space Model immediately gives a model for (n-1)-dimensional hyperbolic space on a half-sphere by looking at the shape of an (n-1)-dimensional hyperplane. I call this model The Poincaré Half-sphere Model.

The third insight is that the Poincaré models' preservation of circles leads to some interesting questions about embedding the Poincaré disk model within The Poincaré Disk Model. Because, in Euclidean space, we can have an arbitrarily sized Poincaré disk model drawn in the center of a larger Poincaré disk model, let's go with that. This means there exists a (probably beautiful) model of hyperbolic space drawn on a disk of any size drawn in hyperbolic space, which I name ""The Hyperbolic Poincaré Disk Models"" (plural because of the arbitrary disk size).

The fourth insight is that the corresponding ""Spherical Poincaré Disk Models"" (which I also suspect to be beautiful) can be obtained by drawing a Hyperbolic Poincaré Disk Model of arbitrary size in hyperbolic space and mapping it to The Poincaré Half-sphere Model.

The fifth insight is that every hyperbolic space has a mirror hyperbolic space, which I see in 2 ways: glue 2 Poincaré Half-space Models together or glue 2 Poincaré Half-sphere Models together.",math,nazgand,False,/r/math/comments/l8lax6/the_poincaré_disk_model_can_be_generalized_to_be/

Possible noteheads as fractions of a whole note of the form 2\^-m

Dots in music are a little more idiosyncratic. The first dot adds half the value of the notehead. The second dot adds 1/4 the value. A wholenote with a dot has a value of 3/2, 1 + 1\*1/2. Numerators in this case are powers of 2 minus one: 2\^(n+1)-1 where n is the number of dots &gt;=0.

My mind was not built for mathematics.,1611958641,"I have flirted with math--on and off--for nearly the entirety of my life. Elementary level math (long-division, two-digit multiplication, etc.) was phenomenal, because it simply snapped into place like a jigsaw puzzle. I found it fun and engaging, and there was always a warm, tingly buzz that whipped up my spine whenever I was to solve something on a worksheet or something.

It gave my young self something to brag about to my friends. I even got so good that I had one of the highest math grades in my elementary school, and tutored kids during lunch or on the playground.

Yet it was the strangest thing: upon entrance into middle school, all of it just fell out. It felt like everything I'd learned was completely useless. My teacher was introducing new topics at break-neck speed, employing, mainly, the method of memorization of specific formulas and equations to apply on tests.

This was disturbing, because it felt to me like I had just become braindead in mathematics altogether. I started seeing people surpass me in every aspect of the class, to the point where I was struggling to maintain a high C.

It was the same, overarching pattern for every class after that. I would start the year off strong with the introductory lessons, and as soon as anything relatively complex were to make itself into a lesson, I would cringe and feel this tightening in my head, like it was purposefully blocking out the digestion of knowledge.

It made me feel horrible. Being in the advanced classes was more of a chore than anything entertaining, and it proved to be so much stress on my brain. Even sitting down to conquer topics like high school Geometry or Algebra 2, even Pre-Calc--it all just fried me to hell.

If I were to define the physical pain I feel while trying to learn new areas of mathematics, it would sound something like this: imagine a having a 103 degree fever while trying to walk around and read a book at the same time. That is the mental stress that it has put on me.

I can't help but believe it was the way they taught math that killed me. The lessons went by so fast, and there was no retention of information whatsoever.

But perhaps it is just the way my mind is constructed; perhaps I am just strictly not a ""math person.""

I have tried, countless times, to teach myself math on my own time--to catch up. Always to no avail. Youtube videos, Kahn Academy, even some textbooks. It even got to the point where my parents resorted to spending, god knows, upwards of thousands of dollars on tutoring. Just attempting to douse myself in the subject physically hurts my brain. It's like having my skull split open in front of an anthill swarming with red ants.

Don't get me wrong, mathematics is in itself, a beautiful language: one that describes humanity's own interpretation of the universe, built up over thousands of years by brilliant individuals in history. Mathematics is the reason I'm living the lifestyle that I do, typing this reddit post as you're reading it. And I have tried with all of my will to not let my inability to learn it taint that perspective.

I just feel that the synapses in my mind are not meant to be stretched in the field of mathematics, because as of recent, I have indulged myself in myriads of books. I am reading like a fiend, gorging on heaps of knowledge and gaining a better understanding of the human condition.

How to decompose the set of ideals of a number field,1611948510,"I remember that when studying the dedekind zeta function there was a neat trick you could use to partition the set of ideals of a number field K into the union of its ideal classes, then represent the ideal class in terms of a representative ideal to end with something a lot more simple.

It decomposes the set of ideals of a number field to a set that simply runs over the integers

However, I now forget how to go from taking a sum over a set of ideals to a set of numbers. My first instinct was using that if I is in the same class group as I_c, there are a,b such that aI=bI_c.

What are career options for part time/freelance mathematicians?,1611938193,"Hi everybody. 

I'm currently in my 30's. I have a math degree from an ivy league university but I've been a musician and freelance math teacher for the past several years. I'm looking to up my math skills so that I can have a better income than just teaching/tutoring. In general, I'm really good at math but it's also not my whole life the way it is for some people. I've been learning coding too but overall I'm not a level of any marketable skill right now. I sort of have two constraints. One is that I'm a professional musician and I don't want to give that up. And two is that I have a nasty auto-immune disease that pops up now and then especially during times of stress. What this means is that I can't have a high stress job where I'm answering emails from the boss at 9pm or staying up late editing code. I basically need to stay well rested and low-stress at all times. Ideally I wouldn't be in a office 9-5 either. My general level of math ability is that I got through an IVY league math degree with a B average with what were honestly pretty terrible study habits. So with putting in a bunch of work I think I could get to a place where I could make pretty good tech/finance money. But due to these constraints I'd much rather work half as much and make half as much money, or even really a third, and ideally from home.

The worst part is that most of the time it works, since there are only so many ways you can combine your parameters using the relevant method you recently learned about.

How do I write a personal statement for applying to do undergraduate research?,1611759401,"I'm currently a junior undergraduate double majoring in CS and Math, and I recently found a summer research opportunity that looks really interesting. I have two professors willing to write letters of recommendation, and the last thing I need for the application is a personal statement. The problem is, the application is very vague -- all it says is ""Personal Statement of interest as it pertains to this program.""

Now, I've written a few personal statements before, but never one about math and one that is read (I would assume?) by mathematicians. Another part of the problem is that I don't see anywhere on the application to upload a resume or my transcript.

With that in mind, how long should the statement be, and what sorts of things should I include? I've mostly only taken intro math major courses (modern algebra/group theory, real analysis, and I'm currently on a class on topology), the most advanced class I've taken was last semester about algebraic geometry where we learned about affine varieties and a lot about Groebner Bases.

At the same time, though, I'm also somewhat familiar with topics beyond the scope of the classes, just from reading on my own. For example, for the final project in the group theory class, I chose to talk about knots and related them to the fundamental group of a topological space. Is that the sort of thing I should include?

TL;DR, this post is mostly a bunch of rambling, but I'd really just appreciate advise from anyone about what people look for in personal statements for research.",math,Miner_Guyer,False,/r/math/comments/l664a8/how_do_i_write_a_personal_statement_for_applying/

Linear transformations between Vector spaces over different fields,1611663538,"Ok so someone recently posted something about wanting to do some calculations around volumes and changing units around and stuff like that. And it kinda sparked my interest in generalizing these ""unit changes"". So I came up with the following theorem (I might preface this by saying that I don't know much algebra):

&amp;#x200B;

Let V, W be finite dimensional K-vectorspaces and ⟨.,.⟩ : V x W → K a bilinearform. Furthermore let V', W' be R-vectorspaces such that dim(V) = dim(V') and dim(W) = dim(W'), \[.,.\] : V' x W'→ R a bilinearform and 𝜙 : K → R a field homomorphism. Then there exist linear mappings L : V → V', S: W → W' such that the following diagram commutes:

     V x W  -- ⟨.,.⟩ -&gt; K
       |                |
     L x S              𝜙
       🠗                🠗
    V' x W' -- [.,.] -&gt; R

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that this requires some generalized notion of linear mapping because the normal one I'm used to working with requires the fields to be equal. But if K=R the theorem is trivial. What you'd need here is basically to have L (and S) such that L(av+bw) = 𝜙(a)L(v) + 𝜙(b)L(w) for a,b in K, v,w in V.

Can someone here guide me in the right direction here? Are mappings like these studied somewhere? I think it boils down to showing that if V is a K-Vectorspace then 𝜙 induces a homomorphic mapping between V as a K- and V as an R-Vectorspace and I think one could even show this for the cases that 𝜙 is an isomorphism but it feels like it should also be possible without bijectivity.

It's very well possible that this theorem is false, it's just something that sprung to my mind :)

As for the motivation:

Consider two length measurements done in cm. Then you can either multiply those (which would be the first bilinearform) to get an area in cm² and then switch the units to m² (which would be the field homomorphism) - or you first change both measurements to meters and then multiply them. This of course doesn't really require vector spaces but I thought hey, why not try it :)",math,SV-97,False,/r/math/comments/l5cvg0/linear_transformations_between_vector_spaces_over/
My favourite number over a million,1611658887,"I've seen on YouTube a few people saying what's their favourite number over 1 million, and recently I thought of a riddle, I got help to find the answer and I realized a number over 1 million in the result, here's the explanation:

Imagine the case, we have a list of numbers from 1 to 100.

Starting on the 1, we have a 1% chance of showing the 1 and a 99% of moving to the next number. Then, as you can imagine, we have a 2% chance of showing a 2 and a 98% of moving to the next number, repeat that until the 100. When we show a number, we move back to the 1.

Example: To calculate the probability of the number 5, it would be the 5%, of the 96%, of the 97%, of the 98%, of the 99% of the times, because you need to include its likelihood excluding the times where the other numbers appear.

With that in mind, the chances of the number 100 to appear after not showing any other number is 1 out of 1071510288125470000000000000000000000000000 times (which is 1 tredecillion 71 duodecillion 510 undecillion 288 decillion 125 nonillion 470 octillion).

Cracking a polynomial from a big set of data?,1611646574,"I’ll spare you the details but I am working on cracking an equation and I’m at a bit of a loss at my next step.

What makes this challenging is that I’m working with a 5 part polynomial and while some of my data is numerical (in our above example my data for w could be 4 or something) some isn’t (y could be the word “green”) now obviously it must get converted to a number at some point, but it certainly mucks things up.

Now we want to show that any other fibre of the Hopf map can connect any other point in S3 to antipodal points along E. If the point on S3 is (z1,z2) I can use a complex number λ in order to 'rotate' the fiber into the plane of x4=0.

Talk to me about a master's program in applied math.,1611575618,"I'm a math teacher with a bachelor's in math and I'm overdue for getting my master's. Over the last few years, I've been considering my options and have been really indecisive about it. At first, the options I was weighing were between more of a pure math option, or education. I was only considering education because it would be substantially less difficult and it's the smart option if I just want to get it out of the way. Still, I've always been leaning more towards math because it's far and away the more interesting option. But the course work I was looking at was more along the lines of algebra and topology. Recently however, one of the schools I was considering announced a new master's program in applied math.

The school that now offers this applied math program was only on my list because it was convenient for financial and logistic reasons; they didn't have any other master's programs in math before this, so I was considering them as a school to pursue the education option. The fact that the only master's in math they offered was applied didn't really sweeten the deal for me at first. I've always thought of applied math as a mind-numbingly boring alternative to studying ""real"" math. But that perspective has recently changed.

Over the last year, some math modelling competitions aimed at high school students and undergrads have caught my attention. I started taking a close look at the problems and realized that they're not only interesting, but I'm way out of my depth in even trying to find an entry point. I eventually connected the dots and realized that my complete lack of background in applied math methods is the reason I feel so unprepared to approach them. And this has made a program like that look substantially more appealing. I recently found a book that they use in Olin college to teach modelling to freshmen with python, and have really enjoyed working through the first few chapters. I think I would really enjoy a program that focuses on more of that

So to be clear, I'm really interested in the modelling aspect that I think a program in applied math would focus on. The thing that's still holding me back is I suspect the course work will also spend a lot of time on various algorithms, which is what I used to think about whenever I'd see the words ""applied math"" and totally turn off any level of interest. I've done some real superficial research into algorithms in the past for different reasons, like finding out how a TI-84 approximates the solutions for zeroes in a function, since it's something I frequently use in my classes. It didn't take long for me to realize how little that type of thing appeals to me, but looking at the same kind of thing with more context, that is developing and using algorithms as a means to an end, has sort of turned my opinion on its head.

So that's all I have to say about this. I'm hoping that little essay does a good job of expressing my views on applied math as well as what I'd like to get out of it. I'm hoping that some of you who have done this same kind of course work might be able to either confirm that it is what I think, and if not set me straight.

Open problems of Kaczynski (PhD thesis),1611545606,"Hey guys, I was wondering if there was someone here who knew more about this field than I do whether or not the following problems, outlined by T. J. Kaczynski (yes the scumbag serial killer) remain open or not?

1. If $A$ is an arbitrary set of type $F_{\sigma, \delta}$ in $X,$ does there necessarily exist a real-valued continuous function $f$ defined in H having A as its set of curvilinear convergence? If $\varphi$ is an arbitrary real-valued function of honorary Baire class 2 on A does there exist a continuous real-valued function f defined in H having A as its set of curvilinear convergence and $\varphi$ as a boundary function?
2. (First proposed by J. E. McMillan) If A is any set of type
$\mathrm{F}_{\sigma \delta}$ in $\mathrm{X}$ and if $\varphi$ is any function of honorary Baire class $2\left(A, S^{2}\right)$ does there necessarily exist a continuous function $f: H+S^{2}$ having A as its set of curvilinear convergence and $\varphi$ as a boundary function?
3. If $f$ is a real-valued Borel-measurable function defined in $\mathrm{H},$ is the set of curvilinear convergence of f necessarily a Borel set? What if $f$ is assumed to be of Baire class $1 ?$
4. Let $\mathrm{S}=\left\{\langle\mathrm{x}, y, \mathrm{z}\rangle \in \mathrm{R}^{3}: z&gt;0\right\}$. If $\mathrm{f}$ is a function defined in $\mathrm{S}$, we define the set of curvilinear convergence of $\mathrm{f}$ in the obvious
way. If f is continuous, is its set of curvilinear convergence necessarily a Borel set? Is it necessarily of type $\mathrm{F}_{\sigma \delta} ?$

ENS Paris for pure mathematics,1611522927,"Hi, I'm an undergraduate mathematics major in the US. I recently found a thread about going to graduate school (for a masters or PhD) in Europe, and started looking into it myself.

Some info: I am interested in **pure mathematics**, specifically I am very interested in doing research in the (geometric) **Langlands Program** in the far future (after I get around to understanding it.) I am also interested in algebraic topology, but I've only just started my first grad course in it.

From what I've read, the ENS (Paris) is a great school for mathematics (and all around a great school.) As an intl. student, I can apply as soon as my sophomore year, and if I am accepted, I go there for 3 years and come out with my masters.

I have some questions.

* Is it suboptimal to go there for pure mathematics (since, at least to me, they advertise a lot of applied mathematics curricula)? 
* Algebraic geometry is crucial to the Langlands Program (I think?) I would guess, since Grothendieck did much of his work in France, that I would get exceptional training in algebraic geometry at ENS Paris. Is this accurate? What about other areas important to the Langlands Program?
*  If I went to ENS Paris, I would probably go on to apply to many US PhD programs. How do my chances change if I apply out of ENS Paris rather than just going straight from undergrad --&gt; PhD programs? I would guess it couldn't hurt me, but I don't know.

Linear Algebra is the Best Subject for Introducing Proofs,1611516731,"After teaching linear algebra for a few years I've come to the above conclusion.  I just wanted to express my thoughts and get other people's opinions on the matter. 

To be more precise I think it's best introduction for people who struggle with abstract logical reasoning common in mathematics. That is, I see it as a useful bridge between ""math people"" and ""non-math people"". It's a great subject for getting ""non-math"" people to understand how and why mathematicians do proofs. 

There are few factors I can think of that make it ideal:

1. It is familiar. Fundamentally linear algebra about linear equations which most students will be pretty familiar with and will have some intuition about how they work and why they might be relevant to your life (if you're thinking of a scientific career for instance). Compare this to something like Abstract Algebra. You are immediately asked to contend with an abstract notion of a ""group"" which is presented in terms of a list of axioms. Some people aren't that good at abstract logical reasoning based on axioms and so may struggle to get started with abstract algebra. But this isn't so much of a problem in Linear Algebra as people usually have at least a mechanical understanding of what you can and can't do with linear equations, even if they can't explain the fundamental axioms they are employing. 

2. It is concrete.  Most of the proofs you do in linear algebra can rephrased in a computational sort of way that concretely show that the reasoning is valid. For example take the statement ""T is injective if and only if null T = 0"". You can provide a concrete example illustrating the important reasoning by providing a linear transformation T and asking them to find 1. a vector in null T, 2. two vectors x, y such that T(x) = T(y). Once you have your v and x and y verifying you are correct just requires basic arithmetic. I think this ability to easily and simply verify that what they did was right is really important for the learning process. Seeing that things play out in the way you expected gives students confidence in their ability to reason about the material. Compare this to something like real analysis. You might get a question like proving a certain function is continuous. But there's no simple way of translating this question into something that can be easily verified with something like basic arithmetic. If you're not good at abstract logical reasoning then there's no obvious way to give you assurance that your reasoning is correct.

Is it a good sign that I'm starting to visualise math more both in practice and the real world?,1611497270,"So I consider myself a beginner. But maths has become a new passion/hobby off mine.

And self teaching and understanding the why and how an algorithm works(equation, formula) whatever you guys call it (I come from a programmer mindset so forgive me if I don't use the correct terminology) as he really taught me maths than any teacher.

Figuring out the why something works is really fun, and I tend to create visual representations of how stuff works on a small scale (if I can) or visualise in a different way on paper. Sometimes I prove something, and realise ""oh someone else has come to the same conclusion but put into a nice equation for me"", other times it's the reverse and I learn the formula/equation first, and figure out how that works. 

I guess I'm more a visual type person. And now started to be able to visualise and do the math I've learnt and understood better in my brain.

It's like my brain has reacted to this new stimuli (maths) and has started to re-program itself and change and add some new source code to make by brain better at this.

But It's now easier to visualise this stuff in my head and even starting, unconsciously, start thinking about things in everyday life more mathematically and try and solve problems. Albeit simple problems, but trying to apply the stuff I've learnt to the real world.

(fluid dynamics) Can math can make my carburetor more efficient? A two part equation,1611478508,"I am tuning up an old Toyota right now, and some time in the past an aftermarket carburetor was installed by somebody who did not read the manual for the carb.

What should have been done at install was to include a fuel pressure regulator. I could do that now no problem, but I have another issue with the fuel lines being too close to the heads and boiling in the lines. Why not get two birds stoned with one joint and route the fuel lines in a way that keeps them below boiling point and reduces the initial PSI from the pump by half?

Only problem is I don’t know how to convert GPH to PSI, or what pressure loss that fluid has per foot of line and degree of bend. If:

-X equals whatever PSI you get from 8 gph through 1/4” diameter tube

-Y equals total pressure loss in psi from an unknown distance and degrees of bend in a 1/4” diameter tube in a liquid with a specific gravity of approximately 0.75

Alternate Divisibility Rule for 11,1611471647,"The status quo divisibility rule for 11 is to take the alternating sum of the digits to see if that’s also divisible by 11 (e.g. 517 is divisible by 11 because 5-1+7=11 is divisible by 11). The proof comes from the observation that 10^k mod 11 alternates between 1 and -1. 

I was randomly thinking of this and noted that another interpretation would be to instead observe that 10^k mod 11 alternates between 1 and 10 (since -1=10 mod 11). This led me to come up with a different divisibility rule for 11 that I haven’t seen around before:

A number is divisible by 11 if the sum of all consecutive 2-digit pairs within the number is also divisible by 11. (For numbers with an odd number of digits, pretend there’s a 0 in front.) e.g. 517 is divisible by 11 because 05+17=22 is divisible by 11.

Other examples:
110: 01+10=11
1650: 16+50=66
29711: 02+97+11=110

I feel this might be a “better” divisibility rule to teach kids because it has an easy to remember parallel to the divisibility rules for 3 and 9 (adding digits). Virtually no lay people remember the status quo divisibility rule for 11 because it’s taught in elementary school math while alternating sums don’t even ever come up again until high school math in the context of series. 

Even though this alternative is a bit more tedious, for everyday life it’s much more useful (in both memory and practicality). 

I would love to hear if you’ve ever heard of this alternate rule before and if you agree or disagree on the practicality of implementing this over the status quo divisibility rule for young students.",math,sifma3,False,/r/math/comments/l3uld4/alternate_divisibility_rule_for_11/

Suppose, there is no t variable, now what? Make a guess!

Ideally: F(Ti,j, Ti+1,j , Ti-1,j, Ti,j+1, Ti,j-1)=0

With guessed values: F(Ti,j, Ti+1,j , Ti-1,j, Ti,j+1, Ti,j-1)= err(/=0)

Objective is to reduce error as much as possible

Requirements

Write down discretized equations(interior, boundary)- explicit, implicit?

Specify what algorithms are used and how to program?

I’m in my 30’s and want to start my education over!,1611341785,"I’ve always loved two things in life: computers and space (okay, reading too). I want to really redirect my life right now and aim my career towards something I love. I’ve been staring hard at something computer science, even physics-oriented. But! I’m scared of my math.

I loved math as a kid. I always thought it like a puzzle, and going through the process of “solving for x” was just trying to solve the puzzle! But as I progressed, things got worse and worse. I was so lost in Algebra II, Trig, and Algebra III. I excelled in Geometry but that was it. I got to college and tried doing College Trig and failed out immediately! I just gave up there.

But now, I really want to give it a good try again. But I want to start over, maybe? If it’s possible? I know I’m older and things might be more difficult, but I want to find that “link” that got broken in my education and I want to build up from the ground up and finally GET math. From the bottom up! From the very start!

Is this realistic of me? To “learn” math in my 30’s and get into advanced careers somewhere in computer programming, Astro physics, or other math-intensive sciences? Where can I even begin? I’m no dummy, I just- I want to say I had bad teachers. But I don’t know. Maybe I’m NOT a math person and that’s why I fell off in HS?

Smallest fraction denominator within a certain percentage of a decimal?,1611337904,"I am trying to price items in a multiplayer video game that has a currency market. The exchange rate is expressed as a decimal ratio, but buy/sell prices can only be expressed as non-decimal fractions in a listing, so my methodology is:

1. Check the current market price
2. Specify an arbitrary profit margin I find acceptable
3. Convert the resulting ratio to a fraction

I would like to make the denominator of the resulting fraction to be as small as possible (people like nice round numbers), so I would like to specify an acceptable deviation for my final ratio and get a nice looking fraction within that range. Example:

1. Selling market price of item is 1:1.3 (0.769)
2. I want to sell with a margin of 5% above the market price, so (1/1.3)*1.05=0.8077

Now, in my head, 0.8077 is pretty close to 0.80, so I'd specify pricing of 4/5. However, I want to do this programmatically, so:

1. Specify an acceptable fraction conversion error of 0.01
2. This makes the acceptable ratio range 0.7977 to 0.8177
3. Find the fraction with the lowest possible denominator that falls within that range
4. (Manually estimating in my head) resulting fraction is 4/5, because 0.8000 falls between 0.7977 and 0.8177

A (non)-Bias in Primes,1611290970,"There is a bias in primes, typically known as Chebyshev's Bias or the ""[Prime Race](https://dms.umontreal.ca/~andrew/PDF/PrimeRace.pdf)"". Basically, this bias says that if you start going along the number line and sort the primes into two bins as you go along, one bin for prime that are 1 mod 4 and the other for those that are 3 mod 4 (we can ignore2), then for 99% of this ""race"" there will be more primes in the 3 mod 4 bin. That is, most of the time there are more primes that are 3 mod 4 than there are primes 1 mod 4.

This works in greater generality. If we sort primes mod N then there will (usually) be more primes in buckets x mod N where x is *not* a square mod N than in the buckets y mod N where y *is* a square mod N. It seems as though the primes try to avoid being quadratic residues as much as they can.

This is a bit odd in light of [Dirichlet's Theorem on Primes in Arithmetic Progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet%27s_theorem_on_arithmetic_progressions), which says that the primes are all equidistributed in appropriate residue classes as a whole. Though, it isn't inconsistent with this result, as it merely says that at the end - even if non-residues are in the lead for most of the race - it will end in a tie. But this bias still exists and there should be a meaningful reason for it.

To dig into these results a bit we, naturally, end up working with the Zeta function and its friends. These do, after all, hold information about how primes are distributed within its analytic properties. But with these functions (and some strong Riemann Hypothesis assumptions) we can prove this bias and quantify it pretty well (see [here](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.em/1048515870) for more). But with this analysis we can actually see how we are, in a way, creating this bias.

The zeta functions do not tell us about primes. They tell us about prime *powers*. A lot of results about primes which use the zeta function actually prove a related result for prime powers, and then get rid of the contributions to higher prime powers through some kind of approximation or correction. You can see this happen in the [Divergence of the Sum of Reciprocal Primes](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Sum_of_Reciprocals_of_Primes_is_Divergent#Proof_1) and in the Prime Number Theorem when we [pass to the Chebyshev Function](http://www.math.niu.edu/~jthunder/Courses/2015Fall/480/sec1/chebyshev.pdf). Overall, the zeta functions tell us that prime *powers* are the natural objects of study when it comes to the distribution of primes.

The proof of Chebyshev's bias is along the same lines: Get rid of the contributions of higher powers through some asymptotic bound. But through this process is when we end up creating the bias itself. There is no Chebyshev's Bias for the prime *powers* and it is through the exclusion of higher powers that we create the bias. To see how this works, we can consider the case of sorting the prime powers mod 4. When we do this, *every* prime-square will fall into the 1 mod 4 bucket. That's a lot of numbers that automatically go to one of the buckets and to balance it out we will need the primes to act as counterweights which means favoring the 3 mod 4 bucket. And so Chebyshev's bias exists to prevent a bias in the distribution of prime *powers*.

I'm not the best at making graphics, but you can track how often one bucket is favored over the other as a percent and when you compare primes to prime powers, you can see the bias disappear in [this graph](https://imgur.com/a/zfDnm1R)). There are some scaling factors in here, but these arise from how Chebyshev's function tells us we should weight prime powers when counting them. Overall we can see that, in the end, Chebyshev's bias is an *anti*-biasing mechanism. 

But, in the end, [Terry Tao can explain things much better than I](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2016/03/14/biases-between-consecutive-primes/), though he didn't include a poorly made Python graph to illustrate things.",math,functor7,False,/r/math/comments/l2gcer/a_nonbias_in_primes/

Fun math puzzle for the logicians out there!,1611271526," 

A number of small cubes are to be assembled into a larger cube.

Once built, the entire outer surface of this large cube is to be painted blue. Some of the

small cubes will end up with three of their faces painted. Some will end up with two of

their faces painted. Some will end up with one of their faces painted, and some will have no

paint at all (the ones on the inside).

we see a large cube made from 4 x 4 x 4 small cubes.

Questions 1 – 4 refer to the large cube in case 4. Question #5, is asking about a general cube

like these.

How to determine the best sample to take to avoid error amplification,1611249699,"Let's imagine I have to pick two data points, one from a list:

* 01-Jan-2020 = 100
* 15-Jan-2020 = 200
* 30-Jan-2020 = 300

...and one from a set date:

15-Feb-2020 = 400

What I'm looking for is a simple and performant way to forecast future data, but I only ever want to use 2 data points.

I have a rule that the ideal gap between my two samples is 28 days (around one month).

Looking at my data:

* 01-Jan-2020 is 45 days before 15-Feb-2020
* 15-Jan-2020 is 31 days before 15-Feb-2020
* 30-Jan-2020 is 16 days before 15-Feb-2020

So I pick the 15-Jan-2020 data point, as this is closest to 28 days from 15-Feb-2020.

This all works fine, but sometimes I don't have data that's so nicely ordered. Say my historical data looks like this:

* 10-Dec-2019 = 10 (67 days before 15-Feb-2020)
* 14-Feb-2020 = 380 (1 day before 15-Feb-2020)

In this more extreme case I might decide that the sample from 10-Dec-2019 is better to use, as using a sample from yesterday has a higher chance of amplifying any error, particularly if I know my data is rounded or likely to contain small errors.

However, this breaks my rule, as 67 - 28 = 39 and 28 - 1 = 27, so the sample from yesterday is easily closest to the 28 day ideal gap I'm looking for.

So my rule becomes:

* Find the data point that's closest to 28 days old;
* Unless it's ""too close"" to the current data point, in which case favour an older sample.

But for the life of me I can't think how to express this mathematically, or even what the correct words would be here. Is there a simple formula I can use, something, that's easy to calculate, and doesn't involve creating some sort of graphical model before deciding which sample is best to use in every case?

My use case here is that I want to forecast based on two data points with enough distance between them to avoid error amplification, but not too far apart, as that might miss recent changes in the trend.",math,Diksta,False,/r/math/comments/l22yvi/how_to_determine_the_best_sample_to_take_to_avoid/

I developed an algorithm that I am really starting to question now regarding as the best way to compare values in order to determine an unknown. I know this is computer science, but I am just discussing the raw mathematics behind what I did.

Basically for the first function:

d =|(X0 - Xi)| where d is the difference between your comparison value Xi and the value you are comparing it X0. The smallest d value is considered to be the closest match.

For two it becomes

d = |(X0 - Xi)| + |(Y0 - Yi)|

where the two differences between the values are calculated and added together. The smallest overall difference is d.

And for three:

d = |(X0 - Xi)| + |(Y0 - Yi)| + |(Z0 - Zi)|

Observations on Vortex Math Sequences,1611172724,"So, I've been trying to find something weird or interesting to think about when I stumbled across Vortex Math Sequences. A simple little thing that started with the supposed quote from Nikola Tesla about the ""power"" of the numbers 3, 6, &amp; 9.

As I understand how the sequence works, you take a number and double it. If the number has multiple positions, you add the digits of that number together, and repeat until you are left with a single digit.

&gt;1+1= 22+2= 44+4= 88+8= 16= 1+6= 716+16= 32 = 3+2= 532+32= 64 = 6+4 = 10 = 1+0 = 1**Sequence:** 1-2-4-8-7-5-1  
&gt;  
&gt;3+3= 66+6= 12= 1+2= 3**Sequence:** 3-6-3  
&gt;  
&gt;9+9= 18= 1+8= 9**Sequence:** 9-9

What this has to do (other than being an interesting or weird fun math fact) in a practical setting, I have no idea.

HOWEVER!

I did ask myself... ""Huh. I wonder what it would look like in other Base formats""? - So... I tested it in a couple Base formats below and above Base 10. I will spare you the math proofs, and just provide the Base and the sequences.

&amp;#x200B;

|Base 8||Base 9|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Repeating Sequence: 1-2-4||Repeating Sequence: 8-8|
|Repeating Sequence: 3-6-5||All Paths Lead To 8|
|Repeating Sequence: 7-7||5-1-2-4-8 / 3-6-4-8 / 7-6-4-8|
||||
|Base 11||Base 12|
|Repeating Sequence: 2-4-8-6||Repeating Sequence: 8-5|
|Entries into Repeating Sequence Above: 1-2 / 7-4 / 9-8 / 3-6||Massive Chain Entry Into Above Sequence:|
|Repeating Sequence: A-A||B-A-9-7-3-6-1-2-4-8-5-8|
|Entry into Above Sequence: 5-A|||

I find it weird that in Base 9, everything lead to one number (8) which then repeated on itself.And in Base 8 there are practically 3 separate contained repeating numbers, one of which just repeats in on itself. Base 11 is just weird in that each branch is basically just 2 digits until they all hit a Repeating Sequence. And Base 12 is basically a full single digit chain until the end which repeats the last two digits.

&amp;#x200B;

Again, other than being interesting fun facts... I wonder if there are any real world applications for such knowledge.

Do high school students (prior to learning calculus/linear algebra) have much to gain from learning to use MATLAB?,1611164107,"I'm a high school math teacher and I've recently started noticing some interesting math modelling challenges aimed at high school students. It turns out that applied math in this sense is surprisingly far from my wheelhouse, so I've been poking around for learning/teaching resources, and it seems like there's a pretty robust curriculum for math modelling problems built around using MATLAB. I don't have any first hand experience with this software, so before I invest a ton of time into it, I figured I'd see what you all think about this.

For a little background, the target student population either is or has been in a project-based learning engineering program during their freshman and sophomore years. They're very superficially introduced to matrices in 10th grade, get a little more background on them in 11th, and then take calculus in 12th. In terms of data analysis, they learn some basics in 10th grade, which goes as far as normal distributions and some light work with monte carlo methods. There is an AP statistics course available to seniors, but most of the strong students take calculus instead (I know, I know.) They also get some basic coding experience from the engineering program, and then juniors and seniors get more through two AP computer science courses.

Like I said, my interest is in starting a program at my school based around using MATLAB to tackle modelling problems, but I'm just not sure how much math these students would need to know in order to be able to make any use of it at all. Any thoughts?

Here are a couple of example problems that I'd like to structure the class around:

Alternative way to visualize 2D graphs - thoughts?,1611157683,"Most of you are probably familiar with the popular math youtuber Grant Sanderson, from 3blue1brown. Well, he came up with (or at least showcased) an alternative way to visualize 2D graphs. Basically, both the input and output are represented by horizontal real number lines. For each value on the input line, a line is drawn to its corresponding output on the output line. Here are a few examples to solidify the idea:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/z332e6wiaic61.jpg?width=802&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ffa88986d134dd2e0b20bcfac494f47f0b7e141

The lower line is the input and the top is the output. As expected from a sine function, all values are mapped between the wave amplitude. Personally, I think this visualization beats the traditional 2D cartesian plot of a sine wave.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jfrs222saic61.jpg?width=801&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f787e5005846c5aad019699593db6af175dbe223

Obviously, 1/(3+x) can't ever be zero, so the alternative plot creates this empty ellipse of lines. In general, this is true with any function that has a infinite discontinuity where the one-sided limits in both directions diverge to the opposite sign of infinity. While this looks nice, a traditional plot is probably better in this case, as it's hard to map an individual input to its respective output. This could be remedied by reducing the input sample density, but that also lowers the information density. What do you think?

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0dm6zrejbic61.jpg?width=802&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4d955f6b453279ea66ff073c5062c751a60b7f37

This is an example of what a parabola looks like with this type of graph.

In my opinion, each type of graph has its strengths and weaknesses.

Strengths of traditional graphs:

1. It's easy to see how a given individual input maps to its outputs
2. In the context of motion, a cartesian graph will look like the actual path of motion of an object
3. It's what people are used to

Strengths of the alternative graphs:

1. This can be generalized to arbitrarily high dimensions and represented fully in the 2D plane without any projection. It has the potential to increase our understanding of higher dimensional functions (and complex functions... each complex input and output would just need two separate lines).
2. It clearly shows how the entirety of the input is transformed by a function into the output. You could imagine particles starting at the input samples and gliding across the lines to the output space.
3. It's not so hard to get used to. Even though everyone is accustomed to traditional 2D graphs, this is a pretty simple concept and I believe people would get used to it pretty quickly.

Clearly, traditional graphs have benefits that these graphs do not. So, these wouldn't be a replacement for 2D graphs, just another tool we can use to understand functions. What do you all think of this?",math,sam-lb,False,/r/math/comments/l1bqwc/alternative_way_to_visualize_2d_graphs_thoughts/

I am just learning about Bayesian methods, and I tried a simple biased coin flip experiment in which I generate a random array of binary data, using a uniform random variable distribution and letting every value &lt; 0.35 represent heads and any value &gt; 0.35 represent Tails.

Because we only have two possible outcomes, the likelihood function of choice is the Binomial distribution, in which ""p"" (the probability of an outcome) is treated as a random variable. With each new coin flip, we add its outcome to the data pool and update our posterior distribution. As the number of flips N goes to infinity we see the posterior distribution (which is Gaussian-ish in shape) converges to a Dirac-Delta distribution (albeit very slowly) centred at exactly p = 0.35. This is all good and fun.

My question is then, how do we extend this reasoning to more than 2 outcomes? 

Say I have a biased die where 6 lands 40% of the time, and the other 5 numbers land with equal frequency adding up to 60%. I have seen people approach this by using a multinomial distribution as the likelihood function in the Bayes formula. However, if you were interested in the posterior distribution of just 6's (that is, how likely you are to roll a 6), would't you use a Binomial distribution where you test the probability of rolling a 6 vs. NOT rolling a 6? It would seem that you can frame the problem in terms of: 

\--&gt; Likelihood function = Prob( rolling a 6 )\^(number of 6's) x Prob( not rolling a 6 )\^(number of not 6's)

Or am I confusing myself? How does the multinomial distribution come into play here?",math,James_Colberg,False,/r/math/comments/l12v9q/how_to_choose_the_right_likelihood_function_for/

Crystal Lattice Problem in Anime,1611120929,"Hey guys, I am watching Assassination classroom season 2 episode 12 and at this point in the show, the students are taking their finals. The final question  goes: 
The crystalline structure known as a body centered cubic unit consists of multiple cubes of edge length A, arranged periodically, with an atom at each vertex and at the cube's center. Most alkaline metals, including sodium and potassium, are body centered cubic units. For a given atom A[0] in a body centered cubic unit, the domain D[0] is defined as the set of all points in the space closer to A[0] than any other atom. Find the volume of D[0].

I ask for help so you guys can use any method. Just fyi, there were two approaches used in the anime. One was finding the non-domain volume from the volume of the cube. The other was based more on the statement stating ""arranged periodically"".

Mathematical writing style: can I generally define (named) assumptions to use throughout the paper?,1611104948,"I am currently writing my bachelor's thesis and I am unsure about specific writing style conventions:

I have several theorems throughout different chapters that all have the same assumption, which is really long and cumbersome.

It feels weird because a smoothness assumption is kind of a preexisiting term but is not well defined either... Or should I not do it as a definition but instead define an assumption environment?

So for practice, every time he opened up his laptop, the laptop would give him a random date and the password to open the laptop would be the corresponding day.

"On the ""stringiness"" of associative algebraic structures",1611099721,"In a certain sense, all associative algebraic structures  (semigroups, monoids, groups, rings, modules, etc.) inherit their core structure from that of strings under concatenation. This is easiest to see for the first three of these structures: semigroups, monoids, and groups. The respective free objects in each category can be constructed as the set of strings over a certain alphabet (the generators, or the generators and a set of inverse symbols, etc.), with binary operation given by concatenation, taken modulo certain structure-appropriate relations. This means that semigroups, monoids, groups inherit a set of limitations peculiar to working with strings of symbols. One clear example of this is the way cancelation works out. In a group, if *ax = ay*, we can cancel *a* from the right and conclude that *x = y*. However, if we instead have *x_1ax_2 = y_1ay_2*, we cannot necessarily conclude that *x_1x_2 = y_1y_2*. Intuitively, this is because the element *a* that would need to be canceled is ""in between"" the other two elements in the string, and thus we can't ""reach it"" to cancel it, since concatenation only acts at the edge of a string.

In a similar vein, elements of a ring can be seen as ""strings of strings"", or 2D arrays of symbols. Every element of a ring is a linear combination of the generators, and so it consists (in a sense) of a ""horizontal"" string of ""vertical"" strings. Each ""vertical"" string is a product of generators, and is one term of the sum which constitutes the ""horizontal"" string. A module adds a third dimension, with ring elements chained together in linear combinations of module generators. Non-associative structures are not ""stringy"" in this way. If a structure isn't associative, then concatenation fails to be a natural operation on the structure. Non-associative algebraic structures instead inherit their properties from rooted *n*-ary trees, where *n* is the order of the operation. Again, this is mirrored by how you construct free objects in these categories. This means that in some sense, strings are just rooted trees modulo associativity.

It would seem that adding commutativity again causes a simplification of the core structure at play. Once we add commutativity, we *can*  cancel an element in between two others. We go from working over strings under concatenation to working over multisets under union, again modulo appropriate relations. So I have two basic questions here, that hopefully someone around her might have some insight on. The first is: is there a way to make precise the fact that magmas are ""tree-like"", groups and rings are ""string-like"", abelian groups and fields are ""multiset-like"", etc. How can we tell what sort of properties we can impose to get us from one domain to another?

Conditions to define a vector field,1611092771,"I'm interested in the relationship between discrete and continuous time dynamical systems.

F^(t+s) (x) = F^t (F^s (x))

for real s, t. A consequence of this is that we can model continuous flows in discrete time by setting, say, f(x) = F^1 (x), and the discrete dynamical system generated by iterations of f is equivalent to the system of flows F.

Such solutions are known to exist uniquely, and are C^1 continuous wrt. t, if the vector field V is Lipschitz continuous. My question is: under what conditions can we do the reverse?

Am I understanding discreteness correctly?,1611090662,"These are a few notions of discreteness that I know of:

* Discrete sets, which are defined as sets with an injective map into the natural numbers.
* Discrete categories, which are defined as categories with only trivial morphisms.
* Discrete topologies, which are defined as the largest topology over a set (i.e. the power set).
* Discrete σ-algebras, which are defined as the largest σ-algebra over a set (i.e. the power set).

I noticed that discrete categories, topologies and σ-algebras refer to certain spaces where we resort to ignoring the structure because no specific properties of the structure are assumed. For example,

* There are no interesting morphisms in discrete categories so (small) discrete categories are not really better than sets.
* Every set in a discrete topological space is an open neighborhood of itself, which makes topology on discrete sets mostly useless.
* Same goes for σ-algebras: every function from a space with a discrete σ-algebra is measurable. This does not seem to make much of a difference in practice, except that we may fail to define a measure.

Unless I am missing something, these three are left adjoint to the corresponding forgetful functors. This at least fits my intuitive understanding of adjoints as ""generalized inverses"" (see [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2019/entries/category-theory/)). This is also the motivation behind naming free monoids, free groups and free modules, is it not? ""Free of any restrictions""?

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part IV: What Do I Do Now? What Happens Next?
**

&gt; As advisors of students in college, the editors frequently come across students who ask “What can you do with a degree in mathematics?’’ This is
really hard to answer, because, in a way, “anything’’ is not too far from the
truth. At its very core, studying mathematics helps students become better at
critical thinking and problem solving, two skills that are essential in today’s
world. Since the editors of this book are all professors ourselves, it can be
daunting to talk to students about the so-called real world and what jobs are
really out there.

&gt; Students struggle with finding themselves as a mathematicians and what
to do after they graduate; here are some stories from people who felt that
struggle and resolved that conflict in various ways.

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Question about creating problems with unique solutions in Flow Free game.,1611059589,"I've been trying to make a game similar to [this one](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bigduckgames.flow). In it, you have to connect each pair of dots of the same colour in a square grid.

I have seen other's code on creating these problems. However, in all of the algorithms I found, they can guarantee the existence of a solution but not that the solution is unique. I also want to extend this to surfaces of 3D shapes.

It occurs to me that this may be best thought of in terms of graph theory, with squares as nodes connected to any node they are adjacent to, but I haven't done graph theory for a long time and don't even know where to start looking.

How to determine cycle length?,1610961924,"I really don't know what to call this, or even where to start looking. Any help is appreciated. On to the explanation:

There are many cultural systems out there where numerous items are combined to create an ongoing cycle with cultural significance. The 260-day cycle of Mesoamerica, for example, or the Sexagenary cycle of Asian metaphysics. Many of these have internal ""cycles"", due to simple math. In numerology, there's something similar.

Each letter of a name is believed to influence one's life for as many years as the digital root of the letter's position in the alphabet. So, the letter A is said to be in effect for 1 year, B for 2 years, M for 4 years (22nd letter = digital root of 4), and so on. These are called transits.

So, if your name is Abe Jack Set, your transits would work as in the Table below. What I'm trying to figure out is to determine the actual length of the cycle. For Abe, for example, it's not 8\*7\*8, but just 8\*7, because the 8-year long cycles of the first and last names are the same.

Am I right in thinking that it's simply a multiplication of all the distinct cycle lengths? 

In other words, 2\*3\*4 would be 24 (that 2 is a factor of 4, but usually won't matter - but see exception noted below), but 2\*3\*3 would be 6 (because the 3s are the same and progress in lockstep), and 14\*7\*32 would be 3136. 

The only exception I can think of would be something like Bobo, where the cycle would theoretically be 2+6+2+6=16, but is actually  only 8 because the letter transits would be identical after just one iteration of ""Bo"". Bobx, though, would have the full 16 year cycle.

"Intersection between Game Theory and the ""Environment"" - Discussion",1610940821,"Hello all, sorry if this post isn't very heavy in mathematical content, but I wanted to ask in very general terms, and possibly ignite some discussion, about a game theory in which the ""environment"" changes the nature of the game. Let me be more precise.

My knowledge of game theory is limited, but to my understanding, we often speak of N players operating under some rulesets, seeking to maximize their utility. We speak of players changing their strategies in repeated games, of information about other players' states, and so on. However, I am not aware of a game theory that takes into account a ""non-player."" It might be possible to think of the non-player as a player whose utility function is independent of the actions of the other players, but the converse is not true (i.e. the trivial player). Alternatively, we may speak of the non-player as the change of rules in repeated games (in some rigorous way, of course).

I don't want to impose a formal definition on the non-player because I want as diverse an array of responses/discussion as possible. But it seems to me that such a game theory would be incredibly interesting, for it could be used to form a bridge between other fields of mathematics and game theory - perhaps in a trivial fashion, or perhaps in a nontrivial one. If anyone is aware of such ideas in game theory, please let me know.

12,7/13,13=0,96725  
41/40,08=1,022954

19,15/15.65=1,223642

17,21/14.6=1,17876712

However, if i instead chose to calculate the avarage of the right side and divide by the left side i instead get

(12,7+41+19,15+17,21)/4 =22,515

"Game theory and human-generated ""random"" numbers",1610897082,"So, while chatting with a friend recently, the topic of just how awful people are at generating ""random"" numbers came up. And, as an idle curiosity sort of thing, we were kind of wondering whether it'd be possible to train people out of the ends-with-7-means-random thing and similar biases, and thought up a game that might work (or, at least, fail interestingly) to make people better at generating more realistic ""random"" numbers.

So, here's the game: you have a group of 10 or so people, and each one secretly picks an integer between 1 and 10 (or 0-9 if you want to start there).  If you chose a number that no one else did, you get a point. Or, if you have a group of a couple hundred people, picking integers from 1-100 (or 0-99), where choosing a number that the fewest other players chose would gain that player a point.

With an iterated version, I feel like there are a few variants I can think of based off of how much information about previous rounds is shared. In the low-information version, all the players get is whether they earned a point or not and their own picks, while in the high-information version, they can see what everyone's picks were. And then, there's a sort of medium-information version where you can see everyone's scores, but not the numbers they chose.

Now, I have some guesses on what a couple of optimal strategies might be over arbitrarily many iterations in the high-information variant, but the thing I wonder is what strategies people would come across without prompting, and whether knowing about human RNG biases and/or statistics in general would change that. Like, if you had a skewed demographic for this experiment (only mathematicians, only psychologists, only game theorists, only poker players, only people who don't know how biased our instincts for ""random"" are, etc.) how would both initial and long-term strategies change?

What resources should I draw on to achieve this?",1610848852,"Integration has always been a weak spot for me.

State-dependent Markov processes,1610843036,"I have written a program for generating/recognising strings of symbols which uses basically a random walk algorithm. Can you help me understand what I've created, or point me in the direction of related ideas?

For each string generated, the algorithm keeps track of weighted probabilities for a set of symbols S. All symbols in S start out with equal nonzero weight (including the special ""end string"" character). To decide what symbol comes next in the string, a set of user-entered statements are parsed (written in a domain-specific language). The statements can arbitrarily alter the probability based on a condition on the string constructed so far, which has a restricted window of accessibility on the string (e.g. the head of the string, or the nearest n-gram). 

So for example if the set of string ""aaab"" was generated at some intermediate state, and a statement ""ab + c: 0"" is parsed (read as ""probability of c following a sequence ab is zero""), then the weight for symbol ""c"" is set to zero, because the left side condition ""ab"" is met (""+"" means that the condition will be checked at the head of the string only). And so on for N statements. This keeps going until the 'end string' symbol is picked, then the algorithm halts.

Is there a general name for this kind of process, or any ideas related to it? Is it correct to call it a 'Markov process', even though the state of the system (previous symbols in the string) is accessible to the algorithm?

How to get better at Probabilistic thinking?,1610840316,"There are three important aspects of probabilities that one needs to understand to get better at probabilistic thinking:

1. Bayesian thinking
2. Fat-tailed curves
3. Asymmetries

Bayesian thinking

The core concept is this: given that we are constantly getting new information about our world, we should probably take into account what we already know when we learn something new.

Consider the headline “Violent Stabbings on the Rise.” Without Bayesian thinking, you might become genuinely afraid because your chances of being a victim of assault or murder is higher than it was a few months ago. Let’s say your chance of being a victim of a stabbing last year was one in 10,000, or 0.01%. The article states, with accuracy, that violent crime has doubled. It is now two in 10,000, or 0.02%. Is that worth being terribly worried about? The prior information here is key. 

It's important to remember that priors (information we already know) are probability estimates. For each bit of prior knowledge, you are not putting it in a binary structure, saying it is true or not. You’re assigning it a probability of being true.

Fat tails

You're probably familiar with a bell curve, that nice symmetrical wave that has captured the distribution of so many things from your height to exam scores. You can quickly identify the parameters and plan for most likely outcomes, if we know we are in a bell curve situation.

Fat tails are different. 

In a bell curve the extremes are predictable, there can only be so much deviation from the mean. However, in a fat-tailed curve there is no cap on extreme events.

For example, you will never meet a woman who is ten times the height of an average woman. In a bell curve, the outliers have a fairly well defined scope. But in a curve with fat tails, like wealth, deviation from mean does not work the same way. You will regularly meet people who are thousand or ten thousand times wealthier than the average person. You enter a completely different type of world.

Asymmetries

Finally, you need to think about the probability that your probability estimates are themselves any good. I know, meta, right?

This massively misunderstood concept has to do with asymmetries. A common example is people's ability to estimate the effect of traffic on travel time. How often do you leave ""on time"" and arrive 20% early? And how often is it 20% late? All the time? Exactly. Your estimation errors are asymmetric, skewing in a single direction. This is often the case with probabilistic decision-making.

We can never know with future with exact precision. However, using this framework and thinking in shades of probability can help us act with a higher level of certainty in complex, unpredictable situations.

Here's how one might go about developing the skill of probabilistic thinking.

Attitude:

1. Strategic pessimism
2. Non-attachment to one's ideas
3. Confidence in one's ability to influence others

Skills:

1. Imagination
2. Logic
3. Basic probability and stats knowledge

Prerequisites for reading Kerodon,1610832240,"Infinity-categories are slowly becoming the standard tool in algebro-topological and homological parts of mathematics, so it seems almost essential for any aspiring mathematician with interest in algebra or topology to study them sooner or later. As for where to learn them from, time and again I heard that Kerodon is a good source for learning infinity-categories even if it is incomplete. People said that it is akin to a response to HTT and HA being too hard to read. I've skimmed through some sections, and it indeed has stricken me as accessible (or at least as accessible as a treatise on such an advanced topic can be).

However, this begs the question as to what it's logical prerequisites. Clearly, you have to know basic category theory (say, at the level of Tom Leinster's book or equivalent). For dealing with topological properties (such as geometric realization) of simplicial sets, you need to know some basic topology (let's set Munkres here as a standard reference). What else does one needs to know? I understand some acquintance with algebraic topology is always advised before studying infinity-categories, but how much is needed really? For example, singular homology is somehow connected to simplicial sets, but does one needs to know much more that basic definitions and properties?

Also, how much category theory is needed? Kerodon has sections on monoidal categories and enriched categories, so it doesn't appear it assumes reader to be well-versed in these things. DG-categories as also introduced from the definition.

In any case, I will be thankful to anyone providing their opinion on what Kerodon assumes and what it doesn't.",math,HHINK,False,/r/math/comments/kyrrok/prerequisites_for_reading_kerodon/

"What's your opinion on creating a roadmap for each theorem/definition/result in a digital textbook, especially for research objective based learning?",1610800146,"I've always read books linearly (or at least try to). But I find that it is not an efficient method to read when you aren't reading for a class, especially for the purpose of reading for research.

Often times (usually in research), you are reading with an objective in mind, and there's a big result that you want learn. So what my adviser and many others had advised that you should read that theorem, go back to  read what you need to understand what it is saying and its proof if it's important. So basically only read what you need to understand it.

&amp;#x200B;

Say your theorem is in chapter 8, now:

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you were to read the book linearly, from chapter 1 to 8, then you have no idea which parts of the books is important for understanding the theorem you want to understand. And you may end up reading things that aren't relevant to your research, especially in the first few chapters.
2. Say you first read the theorem, and then go back to read what you need to understand it from earlier chapters (definitions, other results used in the proof, etc.) iteratively. Then this process seems pretty painful, and you still run into the issues of not being able to discern what's important to understanding the result you want to learn. (Let's say I want to understand sobolev embedding theorem for holder spaces, how much do I need to know about holder space? how much do I need to know about sobolev spaces to understand it? etc.). 

&amp;#x200B;

Granted I understand that the latter reading method is an important skill to have for research (especially for research paper). But at least for textbooks, wouldn't it be useful to have a road map to each definition/theorem in the book that includes everything that you need to first read to understand them? Some digital version of textbooks already have something similar, where referenced theorems would be highlighted as a link that takes you to the corresponding page like a reference document for functions and objects in a programming language. 

What I'm proposing is that for each theorem when you click on the theorem it would display (say on a digital version) a roadmap of definitions and theorem you can read in order that is self contained in order for you to understand the selected theorem. Or at least, a display of all the definitions and theorems that you will need to know to understand it - which would allow you to create your own roadmap starting from the lowest level of definitions, lowest in the sense of the hierarchy that's defined by the ordering &lt; on the set of theorems and definitions in the textbook: if definition/theorem A is referenced/used in proof of definition/theorem B, then A&lt;B.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe I'm spewing nonsense here, I can imagine creating such a structure for a textbook would be quiet taxing on the author.

I suppose reading what you need by keep going back to read the things you need for what you want to learn is the default reading mode for research paper (when you want to understand it in detail). So maybe the idea of a journey map isn't really necessary once you have practiced this kind of research-reading sufficiently.

A couple of questions about the foundations of probability theory,1610796083,"I've been reading Terry Tao's notes on probability theory, in particular [this blog entry](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2015/09/29/275a-notes-0-foundations-of-probability-theory/), in which he talks about a distinction between events and random variables on the one hand, and concrete *models* of these on the other. I was interested in getting to know more about this distinction.

Tao writes the following:

&gt; By default, mathematical reasoning is understood to take place in a deterministic mathematical universe. In such a universe, any given mathematical statement S (that is to say, a sentence with no free variables) is either true or false, with no intermediate truth value available. Similarly, any deterministic variable x can take on only one specific value at a time.

&gt; However, for a variety of reasons, both within pure mathematics and in the applications of mathematics to other disciplines, it is often desirable to have a rigorous mathematical framework in which one can discuss non-deterministic statements and variables – that is to say, statements which are not always true or always false, but in some intermediate state, or variables that do not take one particular value or another with definite certainty, but are again in some intermediate state. In probability theory, which is by far the most widely adopted mathematical framework to formally capture the concept of non-determinism, non-deterministic statements are referred to as events, and non-deterministic variables are referred to as random variables. In the standard foundations of probability theory, as laid out by Kolmogorov, we can then model these events and random variables by introducing a sample space (which will be given the structure of a probability space) to capture all the ambient sources of randomness; events are then modeled as measurable subsets of this sample space, and random variables are modeled as measurable functions on this sample space.

He seems to talk about several different levels here:

1. Non-deterministic statements and variables, which seem to be pre-mathematical.

2. Events and random variables in probability theory in general, where he calls probability theory a ""mathematical framework"".

3. Concrete models of these, e.g. we model an event as a measurable subset of a sample space in the Kolmogorov version of probability theory.

He then notices that this ""map-territory"" distinction is present in other parts of mathematics. For instance, we distinguish between an abstract vector space (corresponding to point 2 above) and a concrete system of coordinates for it (point 3). But unless I'm missing something, Tao never defines what an ""event"" or a ""random variable"" is *outside* of some specific approach to the foundations of probability. He later mentions abstract sigma-algebras, free probability and things like that, but as far as I can tell these just offer different approaches in which to model events and random variables, and don't define what these are in the abstract.

In contrast, we *are* able to give an abstract mathematical definition of a vector space, or a manifold, or other structures. (Topological manifolds are no issue, at least. I guess for smooth manifolds we do choose specific charts to get a differentiable structure, but it seems like we get around this by choosing a maximal atlas.)

Tao goes on to define operations on events, but he always does so through a model. In contrast, we are able to define e.g. direct sums of vector spaces without reference to any bases, or product manifolds without reference to charts.

So I had a few questions:

1. Are we able to give a mathematical definition of events and random variables in the abstract? If so, how?

2. If not, then what is the difference between points 1 and 2 above? If events and random variables are not, in fact, mathematical concepts, then what distinguishes them from the pre-mathematical concepts of non-deterministic statements and variables?

3. Also if not, why does Tao call talk of abstract events and random variables ""mathematical"" in the first place?",math,Epistimi,False,/r/math/comments/kyh9no/a_couple_of_questions_about_the_foundations_of/

Is the Cayley-Hamilton theorem as big of a miracle as I think it is?,1610788603,"The Cayley-Hamilton theorem states that the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, *when interpreted as a matrix polynomial,* has the matrix itself as a zero.

Of all results from linear algebra, this one has always astounded me the most. I’ve seen the proof, of course, and understand how it works, but the final statement remains as mysterious as ever to me. It seems like the prerequisites of the theorem should have nothing to do with the conclusion. The characteristic polynomial is not “designed” to operate on the ring of which the matrix is an element, but one level lower, on the ring of coefficients. So why should we expect this conceptual transfer to produce anything besides random results?

It’s almost as if someone claimed “The binary digits of the Mersenne prime M(82,589,933), *when saved as an audio file,* will produce a spoken lecture about Mersenne primes.” There is simply no reason to expect that to be true, because the conceptual connection is missing.

But I’m sure that the real problem is that my understanding of Cayley-Hamilton is just not deep enough. Such ideas tend to become trivial when viewed from the right perspective.

Rate of research and mathematical progress,1610763185,"Forgive me for my lack of knowledge of mathematics history -- that's why I'm posting, I guess. It seems to me that mathematical progress is occurring exponentially, just like technological progress. (In some ways, these are closely related.) It seems that math is becoming increasingly abstract, with more and more training required to make breakthroughs. 

I noticed that most of the references in books and literature I read are from the 1950s+. This makes sense, just like athletic records are consistently updated so it's rare to see a record from the 1940s. But unlike athletic records, which have an upper bound, I'm guessing that math progress has sped up over time. Do you agree or disagree with this statement? 

Has this rate of progress been quantified or discussed? It's obviously complicated, since the relevant fields themselves evolve and branch out. But it seems like back in the days of Newton, you didn't need a rigorous education or research career to make breakthroughs. This is probably due to fewer existing results and less competition. But the ""fewer existing results"" part gets to me -- it's very different now, where one basically needs a PhD to create breakthrough-level research (let alone understand the material).

"Island of Blue Eyes: correct solution, incorrect problem (spoilers)",1610737530,"For brevity, I'll include the following as links (A1| most readers will be familiar with these)

[Problem](https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html) (as expressed by Randall Monroe)

[Solution](https://xkcd.com/solution.html)(as explained by Randall Monroe)

[Inductive Logic solution](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6/) (reddit u/lolbifrons)

While the solution and the iterative logic are all correct (as far as I can tell), the problem as it is often structured contains a red herring, which is an unintentional vestige of structuring the problem for lower populations.

One of the recurring confusions I see when assessing this problem is why these people didn't all leave the island many moons ago. The problem contains an oracle (guru/visitor/speaker) who is presented as giving everyone new information. 

PLEASE STOP READING IF YOU ARE STILL TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM YOURSELF.

Many people run up against the problem that the oracle doesn't seem to provide any new information. Consider that, to apply formal induction to this, we need to begin with the smallest number of islanders possible and examine the problem. With two islanders, one with blue eyes, the Oracle's statement creates new information because:

1) Neither islander know their own eye-colour

2) Nether islander knows what the other islander sees

The oracle's statement tells the blue-eyed islander that at least one of them has blue-eyes so they must be his, and the non-blue eyes islander infers correctly from this that, when the blue-eyed islander leaves (kills himself/ is reunited with Xenu) that his own eyes are not blue.

Let's skip all the ""n"" cases and go the the actual island: On an island with any more than three blue eyed people, everyone on eth island knows the following:

1) There is at least one person with blue eyes (this would also be true two blue eyed people).

2) Everyone on the island knows there are at least two people with blue eyes (this is not true with two blue-eyed people; each of them only knows there is one person with blue eyes and it is possible that that person is the only one, and they might therefore believe that there is not at least one person with blue-eyes).

3) Everyone on the island, including all the people with Blue eyes, already know there is at least one person on the island with blue eyes. (this is inferred from the parenthetical information above).

So on an island with more than three blue eyed people - an island of 100 blue-eyes - everyone knows that everyone knows that there is at least one blue-eyed person. It is illogical to reduce the problem immediately to a three person island because the island never held three people.

**The Point of this post is that the Oracle doesn't introduce new information, but they do provide a critical ""service"".**

If you take a dozen random (correct) solutions from various sources, you will note that *every one uses the Oracle's statement at the starting point (the first night everyone can leave/die/Xenu).* This is so significant that it shocks me that it isn't made more explicit:

**The Oracle provided an indispensable ""Day-1"" on which the inductive process can begin.** Everyone on the island already had all the information contained in the Oracle's statement. To say that they didn't have the knowledge that everyone knew that everyone else could already see one blue-eyed person is a fallacy created by the comparison to the island of two people. This is the long un-identified flaw in the process.

SO reconsider the problem: everyone wants to (has to) leave (Die/Xenu), but without an objective ""Start"" time for the inductive reasoning, measurements such as days are irrelevant. No islander could ever know when the other islanders began puzzling out the solution, and whether each other islander was behaving as thought it were day one, two, or ninety-nine!

One missing piece of information is HOW the islanders all know the rules. Most versions of this problem state that all the islanders are perfectly rational and logical, and also that they know all the ""rules"", but if this is so, when did they learn them.

Two methods of clarification exists (I can see at least two methods of clarification).

1) If the problem indicates that no one knows when everyone else learned of the rules, it would eliminate the question of why no-one figured out how to get off the island before.

2) If the Oracle showed up and told everyone the rules at noon on that faithful day (even without sharing the ""I see..."" tidbit) it would provide a starting point. Perhaps the rules were in place, but the Oracle says ""Starting today, you can leave iff...""

In conclusion, the missing information presented, which all solutions factor in but fail to acknowledge, is not that there is at least one person with blue eyes, or that it is common knowledge that there is one person with blue-eyes, but that there is no start-point until some arbitrary event takes place.

Proper correlation usage question,1610736506,"

Tips on self-learning undergrad (and above) math in a systematic manner?,1610728132,"Hi! 

I'm really curious about mathematics and want to get a better understanding of it. Lately my curiosity mainly has been towards numerical methods for differential equations and in the process of exploring that curiosity I found a lot of interesting information, some of which was fairly accessible to me and had clear parallels with my experience as a programmer.

But of course, vast majority of literature on the subject depends on more advanced topics that I'm quite far from understanding. Some examples would be calculus of variations used in Finite Element Method, Sobolev spaces, Krylov subspaces... 

Unfortunately, I don't have a formal training and due to various circumstances only have an option to study mathematics on my own. I don't expect it to be easy or to end up doing any actual research math, my goal is just satisfying some of my curiosity and getting a better background, so that I'm able to explore more. 

I have basic understanding of proofs, know some calculus and a bit of linear algebra. I can read, say, a book on numerical methods for differential equations and be able to understand and implement (simpler) methods explained there, though I have to skip more complex details and proofs.

What would be a good approach to move forward? I'm considering starting from Spivak's Calculus and Evan Chen's Infinitely Large Napkin, but I'd really appreciate some suggestions. I find it easier to work through books that are fairly terse and ""formal"" (as in, less ""wordy"" and more focused on the subject).

Rosters - they’re just math? No?,1610714613,"I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask but I don’t know where else to try. 
I’m trying to figure out a roster for a group of people. Surely it’s just a question of math, but I have no idea where I’m going wrong.

I have 6 teams of 4 people.
I need at least 8 people on duty on a Saturday and 8 on a Sunday. 
I need approx 16 people on duty on a weekday 

I need everyone to work approximately 2080 hours a year (excluding leave/vacation etc)

Ideally they would work some sort of combination pattern mixing blocks of  4 days on 2 days off and 5 days on 2 days off (Monday to Friday) 

There must be a way to calculate this? But I’ve been trying for more than a week and I can’t seem to make it work. I’ve got close a few times but I keep having problems. Can it be done?

As a student currently taking calculus, maphi has made some super confusing integrals positively simple (with a bit of mental gymnastics to find the right route).

While it still has some problems like trying to do differentiation by parts between a term and dx, it can help understand a simpler route than long expansion. For example, the integral of (2x+1)^5*(3x+1), which wolfram alpha wants to expand but you can simply do integration by parts and a u-sub. 

In conclusion, get maphi, and enjoy problems in a more workable medium.",math,CaptainBlobTheSuprem,False,/r/math/comments/kxnqud/id_like_to_reintroduce_maphi/

Riffle shuffle cycles,1610667404,"When  you riffle shuffle a deck of 52 cards with the first card in front (front top shuffle), you need 8 iterations of this move to end up with the initial deck (with the second part of the deck in front (mid top shuffle) you need 52 iterations, but I'm interested in the the first variant asit's te way card magicians do it. 

The number of iterations necessary to end up with the inital deck depends on the size of the deck.

A friend of mine wrote a python program to find this exact number:

\*\*\*\*\*

class Deck:

def \_\_init\_\_(self, n):

self.deck = list(range(1, n+1))

def \_\_str\_\_(self):

return str(self.deck)

def mix(self):

d = self.deck\[:\]

for i in range(len(self.deck)//2):

self.deck\[2\*i\], self.deck\[2\*i + 1\] = d\[i\], d\[i+len(d)//2\]

def iterations(self):

initial\_deck = self.deck\[:\]

counter = 1

self.mix()

while self.deck != initial\_deck:

self.mix()

counter += 1

return counter

&amp;#x200B;

for n in range(2, 1002, 2):

d = Deck(n)

iterations = d.iterations()

print(f'{n} → {iterations},')

&amp;#x200B;

input('Hit ENTER to exit')

\*\*\*\*\*

We tried to find a pattern in our results: the 2\^x function numbers always have x as their result. BUT for the rest of the deck sizes we failed to find other patterns. Maybe you could help us out! You can run the program if you have python installed on your computer. For the others here are the results for the decks up to 1000 cards:

Shapes with Maximum Volumes for a Given Set of Arrangements,1610620262,"Hello Community, 

*(The question is broadly related to Shapes and Volumes and I have given some background info to help with the discussion)* 

I am currently working on a project for the design of a handheld water treatment system. The technology used to treat water is called electrocoagulation although the details of  that are not important to the question I have. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Here is some background information for my question:**  

1. Electro-coagulation as the name suggests works on principles of electrolysis and would thus require the construction of an electrolytic cell. 
2. The distance between every anode and cathode used in the electrolytical cell should be between 7-8 mm 

&gt;**My question is:**  
&gt;  
&gt;**What mathematical shape &amp; arrangements of electrodes should I go for if I want to ensure the following:** 

1. Maximum volume of water is accommodated within minimum dimensions of the electrolytical cell
2. As water flows through the electrolytical cell, it should have maximum flow path

&gt;**Note:** 

1. Ignore any electrochemical/manufacturing consequences of the shape and arrangement of electrodes)
2. Suggestions for any kind of weird shapes/arrangements will also be appreciated

&amp;#x200B;

***You can find some ideas that I came up attached with this post.*** Any suggestions, ideas are welcome about the shape and arrangement of the electrodes. 

Thanks a lot for any insights, it would really help me a lot!

&amp;#x200B;

***----------------***

*Here is some additional information if required:* 

1. Since I want about 750-1000 ml of water to be treated in every cycle, the electrolytic cell must accommodate about 750-1000 ml of water.
2. The entire electrolytic cell should not have dimensions greater than those given below so that it can carried around easily (consider it to be a handheld water treatment bottle):  

* If cylindrical cell is used: Diameter &lt; 120 mm, Height (max allowed) 210 mm
* If any other shape is used, it should accommodate within the given cylindrical dimensions

Generating PI from the Fibonacci Sequence,1610606215,"I have had a lot of fun recently playing around with numbers in excel, especially phi/golden ratio and the Fibonacci sequence. In addition to playing with the geometry of the Fibonacci spiral. I ended up manipulating things in a way to calculate PI using the sequence. 

I then came across this website where a similar calculation was done, but a bit differently. This site calls their calc the Pi-Phi Product. The website has a word document explaining the math, and an excel showing the calc. They can be found here: [https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pi-phi.xls](https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pi-phi.xls) and [https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PiPhiProduct.doc](https://www.goldennumber.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/PiPhiProduct.doc)

So I know what I have done isn’t novel by any means, but I felt compelled to make a post to give me a reason to fully write out and explain my version, and hopefully see what people think. I do think my version is a bit simpler and intuitive. Both of these calcs essentially follow the Leibniz formula to calculate pi. 

Leibniz formula is basically an alternating sum of fractions, with the denominator of each fraction being each odd number, in increasing order. 

*Processing img uz0j6dmus8b61...*

The key points from this formula are the alternating plus/minus signs, and odd numbers. So I set out to see if I could use the Fibonacci sequence to give me those same things, and basically use them to plug into this formula. 

**ALTERNATING SIGNS** – After playing with the Fibonacci sequence for a while, I was able to find an alternating +1/-1 between each Fibonacci number. I first noticed a +1/-1 when I continued the sequence BACKWARDS/REVERSE instead of forwards. Going forward, each new number is the sum of the prior 2. Going backwards/in reverse, each new number is the delta between the 2 numbers after it. When you do this, you get the following:

… -377, 233, -144, 89, -55, 34, -21, 13, -8, 5, -3, 2, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, etc.

Backwards Fibonacci has the alternating +1/-1 I was looking for. But I also found it in the forward sequence as well. 

Let’s take adjacent Fibonacci numbers of 8 and 13. 

8 squared is 64. Twice of that is 128.

13 squared is 169. 

When you look at the visual Fibonacci spiral representation, you see how the squaring from above is representing the area of the square each arc/quarter circle is within. For each new numbers, say 8, the rectangle of all previous areas would be 8x5 = 40. You can also think of it as the sum of squares of all prior numbers in the sequence. So 5x5 + 3x3 + 2x2 + 1x1 + 1x1 = 25 + 9 + 4 + 1 + 1 = 40. 

So now I do some math with these numbers. I have done a visual representation of what this is doing as well to help illustrate. We are basically finding the difference in area between the current Fibonacci number (13 in this case) from the area of the prior number squared

169 – 128 – 40 = 1

Now do the same thing for the next 2 numbers in the series, 13 and 21. I also realized you don’t have to double the first number, you can just use 

21 squared is 441. 

13 squared is 169. (not double this value this time)

21x13 = 273. (this would be 13x8 instead if I doubled the above value like the first example for 8 and 13)

441 – 169 – 273 = -1

When do you do this for all numbers in the sequence, you get an ALTERNATING +1 and -1. 

Here is my extremely crude representation of what the above is doing to get the +1/-1, basically a difference in AREAS.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img kgcgif5ws8b61...*

OK so I have my +1/-1. On to finding ODD numbers.

**ODD NUMBERS** – The simplest way I found to get all the odd numbers, was to sum consecutive numbers in order. For example, if you have 1,2,3,4,5,6, etc., 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+4=7, etc. So I had how to get odds, I just needed to find a way to generate the basic 1,2,3,4,5,etc. series from Fibonacci. I didn’t want to simply use that series as a given to start with. 

So I needed to find a way to take the Fibonacci sequence and generate a linear progression of numbers. I found this by looking at the math I did from the previous section where I found the alternating +1/-1. Using the first example from above for 8.

8 squared was 64, and 2x that is 128. 

8 times the previous Fibonacci number of 5 is 40.

128 – 40 = 88

88 is -1 from the Fibonacci number of 89.

So in a way, we used Fibonacci numbers we currently were at (5 and 8), to get to +1 or -1 from a Fibonacci number that doesn’t exist yet, in this case 89. 89 is FIVE numbers AHEAD.

When you do this for all numbers, we get a linear progression than increases by 1 each time. This reference forward to future Fibonacci numbers SKIPS every other number as well, it only occurs in reference to Fibonacci numbers that are ALSO positive in the backwards sequence I showed earlier. The excel snippet below helps to illustrate this, each color cell matches the same color cell in an increasing distance as you continue. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eg7ypeyws8b61.jpg?width=624&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2f6db61c783d90a3da40be473f4662aa6ac4bb59

So I now have a linear progression sequence I can make using the Fibonacci sequence. By doing some math to generate a value, I can create each number as a reference to how many Fibonacci numbers forward that value is +1 or -1 from. 

Having my 1,2,3,4,5 etc. sequence derived from the Fibonacci sequence itself, I can then use that sequence to give me the ODD numbers.

**PLUGGING INTO LEIBNIZ** – The rest of what I needed to do was just excel. Taking the excel up to around 500 values of the Fibonacci sequence, it resolves on PI.

I’ve included the excel file as it’s much easier to see. See it here: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlZvMeJA4pOvgZdi73HOgwn3lRTjiSo0/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GlZvMeJA4pOvgZdi73HOgwn3lRTjiSo0/view?usp=sharing)

&gt; Although it may be heresy for me to say this, I am not certain that the proof is totally nailed down. I am convinced, as I've said many times before, that Perelman did brilliant work regarding the formation and structure of singularities in three-dimensional spaces—work that was indeed worthy of the Fields Medal he was awarded. About this I have no doubts [...] The thing is, there are very few experts in the area of Ricci flow, and I have not yet met anyone who claims to have a complete understanding of the last, most difficult part of Perelman's proof [...] As far as I'm aware, no one has taken some of the techniques Perelman introduced toward the end of his paper and successfully used them to solve any other significant problem. This suggests to me that other mathematicians don't yet have full command of this work and its methodologies either.

"exponential distribution, failure rates, and monte carlo simulation",1610511588,"I've been working an interesting problem lately, and I can't seem to figure out where I've gone wrong - or even if I've done something wrong. Let me see if I can lay it out to get some advice from this sub:

Let's say I have a machine that has a failure rate (lambda) of .0024/day, and if it fails, then it takes 10 days to repair the machine. I want to calculate the average number of days per year that the machine is down for repair.

Given this information, I can approach this a couple ways. The first, and most simple, is by multiplying the failure rate by 365. That means .0024\*365=.876 failures per year. If a failure takes 10 days to repair, then this averages to 8.76 days per year of downtime.

The second approach, I perform a monte carlo simulation. The probability of failure in a day is p = 1-exp(-lambda) \~= .002397 from the exponential distribution. The monte carlo simulation generates a random number between 0 and 1 for each day, and if it's less than p, then there is a failure, and the machine is down for 10 days before generating a random number again. When I run this simulation in python for 1e9 days, I calculate \~8.65-8.66 days of down time per year on average. Interestingly, if I take (1-p)\^10, which would be the probability of the machine running successfully for 10 days in a row, and then multiply that by 365, then I end up with 356.3443, and 365-356.3443=8.6557, which is the same (or very close) as the mote carlo simulation result. When I run the monte carlo multiple times, it's consistent within 2 decimal places, which makes me think it's likely equal or very close. Could be a coincidence, too, I suppose.

Intuitively, the first result makes sense based on what (I think) I know about reliability calculations and fault tree analysis. However, the monte carlo simulation seems to make intuitive sense as well. For some reason, I can't reconcile the differences between the two methods. I really hope I'm making a simple, dumb mistake somewhere in the monte carlo, but I've been working on this for days, and I can't sort it out.

Big things happening in Lorentzian geometry,1610505828,"So I bumped into this article [Complex powers of the wave operator and the spectral action on Lorentzian scattering spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00712) and [Essential self-adjointness of the wave operator and the limiting absorption principle on Lorentzian scattering spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09650).

If you care about index theorems or quantum field theory on curved manifolds these results are a big deal. Math phys is finally making some head way into physically meaningful functional analytic results in gravity. 

If you know about Connes standard model then development of the spectral action principle for (even a small class) of Lorentzian manifolds is particularly interesting.

There was a talk about this, in a simple case, this morning by Elmar
Schrohe. If you'd like to get a feel for what this all means.

Title: Index Theory for Fourier Integral Operators and the
Connes-Moscovici Local Index Formulae

Abstract:  The index theory for operator algebras generated by
pseudodifferential operators and Fourier integral operators, more
specifically Lie groups of quantized canonical transformations, has
attracted a lot of attention over the past years. It can be seen as a
universal receptacle for a wide range of index problems such as the
classical Atiyah-Singer index theorem, the Atiyah-Weinstein problem, or
the B\""ar-Strohmaier index theory for Dirac operators on Lorentzian
spacetimes. It also includes work by Connes-Moscovici, Gorokhovsky-de
Kleijn-Nest, or Perrot.

In my talk, I will focus on the particularly transparent situation,
where the pseudodifferential operators are Shubin type operators on
euclidean space. We first study the case, where the Fourier integral
operators are given by metaplectic operators, then we add a Heisenberg
type group of translations, so that we obtain the quantizations of
isometric affine canonical transformations.

We find a cohomological index formula in the first case. In the second,
our algebra encompasses noncommutative tori and toric orbifolds.
We introduce  a spectral triple $(\mathcal A, \mathcal H, D)$ with
simple dimension spectrum.
Here $\mathcal H=L^2(\mathbb R^n, \Lambda(\mathbb R^n))$ and  $D$ is the
Euler operator. a first order differential operator of index $1$.
We obtain explicit algebraic expressions for the Connes-Moscovici cyclic
cocycle and  local index formulae for noncommutative tori and toric
orbifolds.

There is a youtube channel with these talks on it (as well as other stuff): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj_R-LIwCz8101sTdrQ5QNA.

Examples for indirect numerical methods for solving elliptic PDEs Dirichlet boundary condition?,1610476570,"Hey everyone! 

I'm trying to write an overview paper presenting different methods of solving numerical methods for my graduate studies and have some troubles finding methods that qualify as ""Indirect numerical methods for solving elliptic PDEs with Dirichlet boundary condition""

Maybe I don't really see what makes a solving method indirect. From my understanding a direct method would be for example a Galerkin or a Finite Element Method

So to name a few examples I have for an indirect method:

* [Immersed Penalty Boundary Method](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10915-019-00978-3) Where the idea is to look at the problem in a larger simpler domain and enforcing the boundary through a penalty term.
* [Nitsche Method](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crma.2018.11.002) Which allows enforcing Dirichlet boundaries in a weak form without lagrange multipliers (&lt;- this one is admittedly still a bit vague for me)
* Isogeometric collocation method &lt;- frankly unsure about this one, was a suggestion to look into it by a friend.

Does anyone have any idea what I could add to this list? Any tipps or pointers would help.

"Discussing Living Proof: A Dream Almost Deferred, by Emille Davie Lawrence",1610470820,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

This week's essay starts on *page 104* and is titled

A function to model a Temperature mechanic for a game,1610394961,"This is a game mechanic I've been attempting to create for a little while, so far with very little success.  I'd like to solve it by creating some kind of a model to represent the behavior.  Below is an explanation of what I'm trying to accomplish.

&amp;#x200B;

A value `Temperature` is constrained within +1000 and -1000, with extremes of hot and cold at either end.  0 is the default value and is considered a neutral temperature.

Temperature should change based on a value `rateChange`. `rateChange` will be incremented and decremented by certain constants based on factors in the environment like stepping into cold water or standing next to a fire.  If `Temperature` is positive, it should take exponentially longer to become hotter, and vise versa.

Temperature should always be trying to get itself back to 0 (the neutral temp).  If the temperature increased to +300 because of a nearby fire, and then that fire goes out, temperature should start decreasing since that heat source doesn't exist.  The same thing should happen on the negative side.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a function used to represent it taking longer for temperature to increase the hotter you get.  It returns the change in temperature, where x is `Temperature`.

    f(x) = 7e^(-0.00636*x)

The obvious problems with that being it doesn't work for the negatives, and there exists no behavior of `Temperature` trying to get back to it's neutral state. 

Below is a slightly more accurate representation of what I'd like, where C is the change in `Temperature`, t is `Temperature` itself, and r is the `rateChange`.

    C(t, r) = 7e^(r*t)

Most importantly, I want to ask the people here who right now are having a career/work, which works around Math (basic/advance, theoretical/practical) i.e. any sort, how did they get there, how to get there, what is that you do, i.e. what  are the requirements, is it interesting?? etc.

[Request] What is the maximum momentary G force that a modern airliner's wing can take before it snaps in extreme turbulence?,1610361036,"Taken from an aviation safety pdf..



Intensity - LIGHT - Vertical acceleration (g) 0.20-0.49 - Derived Gust (fpm) 300 -1,199


Intensity - MODERATE - Vertical acceleration (g) 0.50-0.99 - Derived Gust (fpm) 1,200-2,099



Intensity - SEVERE- Vertical acceleration (g) 0.1-1.99 - Derived Gust (fpm) 2,100-2,999


Intensity - EXTREME - Vertical acceleration (g) &gt;2 - Derived Gust (fpm) &gt;3,000



The g's in this list is additional g's. So ''&gt; 2'' will read as 3 total g, as there is an *additional* g load factor of 2.


The limit turbulence load (the worst theoretical turbulence the plane would encounter) for modern jets is 90-100 feet per second, or around 6,000 feet per minute. There is a 50% safety margin, so the max turbulence it will encounter before a wing snaps off is about 150 fps.

Will the advances of mathematics meet an end once it gets too big to understand during the lifespan of a human?,1610314623,"It came to my mind when starting my Master's thesis. I wanted to write about a topic in Multivariate Statistics. Okay, that field is way too huge obviously. So I chose to write my thesis in a subfield of Multivariate Statistics: Graphical modeling. Okay, that's still too huge though, so I had to choose a specific type of a graphical model: Structural equation modeling it is! But wait, that's STILL way too huge for a Master's Thesis, and most of this stuff goes completely over my head. Okay, okay, so let's choose a specific type of a structural equation model that I can handle: a linear structural equation model! Great, I only found like ... 100 different research papers. Even though this isn't even a hot topic and relatively young too?! So ... well, let's just describe some nice properties of linear structural equation models. Five sounds good. Oh, that'll be like 150 pages then. Okay, so 2 or 3 properties maybe.

You get it, I guess. I'm wondering: will there be a time where we simply can't really advance in mathematics anymore because

1. mathematicians need to specialize more and more and more, which makes it harder to accomplish some really ""groundbreaking results"",
2. the amount of math that you need learn in order to get to a point where you can actually contribute something gets bigger and bigger?

We live in a time where it's nearly impossible to be a polymath due to the sheer amount of knowledge that one needs to absorb nowadays. Even after several years of studying mathematics, I still feel like I just started out.

I mean, people treat those old mathematicians like Gauß, Euler, Galois and so on as if they were legit demi-gods. But let's be honest here: even though they were probably incredibly gifted and hard-working, the reason why you read those names so often is that they lived during a time when mathematics wasn't as evolved as it is today, and when it was way, way, way easier to accomplish foundational results that shape entire fields.

[Discussion] Mathematical model for problem-solving in Object-Oriented Style.,1610295307,"Greetings! I think designs and engineering of algorithms can inspire a lot from solid mathematical concepts, axioms, and techniques (For one example, set theory has inspired a lot of computational structures).

I've seen that functional programming is well inspired from ""pure"" mathematical syntax. Thus, solving a problem in that system can be reconciled with mathematical approaches. However,

I'm not too sure about a good foundation on Object-Oriented style. Like how do we express a set of methods under a class and define the algorithm under each method in the Class, how do we define super or subclasses? Is there some mathematical syntax for doing those?

Discovery in math books.,1610278932,"Tl;dr: standard math textbooks are not that good, because they do not care about instilling a sense of discovery

Ramanujan is one of the most legendary mathematicians of all time, however, his success is not down to his country, india, or any colleges or schools in india but rather to himself. If I remember correctly, he was an outcast, kicked out from schools and he did everything on his own. All he had with him was a book which merely listed thousands of theorems in various areas of mathematics, and he simply set about proving each of them, and formulating some of his own results in the process. People use the incompleteness of his only aid in mathematics as further proof of his greatness, and while he certainly was great, I believe that the structure of that book definitely helped him. The secretive nature of the book fueled him and strengthened his desire to just complete his understanding, and I feel that that aspect of curiosity and discovery in learning math is completely ignored in math books nowadays. Math books often just list theorems along with proofs and problems about those theorems at the end, the good ones give you the intuition behind the theorems, but very few let you take control, to discover the essence of the theorems on your own, and I think that is necessary in becoming a great mathematician. While 99 percent of books don't do this, an example of a book that does is E.J Barbeau's book on polynomials. In the book, at the start of any given chapter, there are one, maybe 2 pages talking about the broad topic at hand, and maybe some basic results, but the rest is filled in by the reader. All the other results are thought up(with the help of a problem statement included in the book), checked and proved by the reader. Further, there are a bunch of 'explorations', which include a deep dive into one specific topic, which again, follow the blueprint of letting the reader prove the results which can be proved using whatever has been established before. There is a particularly excellent exploration on rook polynomials in the first chapter. But again, as I said, most 'standard' books are not like this, and that's unfortunate.

I have a complete fixture table where after each teams name (and corresponding number) it shows their fixtures based on their numerical order.

However, I am struggling to figure out exactly what number should be assigned to a non-fixture. There is an argument for several different numbers:

0 - pro: Is the obvious number to a assign to a non-fixture

Minus infinity - theoretically if a team has a non-fixture they are absolutely guaranteed 0 points. So it's infinitely worse than actually playing a fixture.

Mathematical anxiety,1610220548,"Hey, Im searching for an advice on mathematical anxiety, or experiences with one. Ive got masters in pure mathematics and went on to PhD just to go with the flow, but had a mental breakdown after a year. Since then, whenever I see mathematical text, I get anxious and start worrying that Ill get crazy from it. I had to terminate studies, but now I entered PhD in Optics. I was expecting to get anxious only from lofty construction and not by real world math but I was wrong. I dont want to give up on learning, so I push hard against it even though I feel I end up in mental asylum. Now I should have my first exam and Im really panicking, even though the subject itself really isnt very hard. Is there a way how to convince my brain theres nothing to worry about and approach the problem solving with clear head?

Now when Im thinking about it, I always had it in me, I always avoided problem solving on my own, wanting instead to be hinted by my peers or finding it on the internet, just because I would worry Im not smart enough or that I waste time. Thats not a good trait for mathematician, but i cant help myself. I dont want to give up on mathematics altogether, given the perils I went through for it.  Im visiting a therapist but she has no experience with this kind of problems. Im on meds, but the panic is still present.

Kind of scared of academia,1610209513,"  Hi. I'm a junior in high school, so I'm stressing out about the far future, but it is still worrying to me. I love math and physics, I like coming up with problems and trying (and often failing) to solve them and generalize the results. So maybe I'd like math research.

   But what people say about academia makes me scared to death of it. I have a bunch of passions in life outside math, from writing to music, and at the moment I can't see how I can fit all of them into my life. And people here say that going to graduate school and getting on track to working at a university means you will be spending all of your waking hours (and most of your should-be-sleeping hours) on frustrating math, trying survive in a vicious competition between intimidatingly smart people all while not earning enough money to eat adequately. For me, a non-competitive, health-conscious, indecisive-in-their-passions person, this doesn't sound like a good life at all to me. I want to teach and think about interesting problems, I don't want all the other things!

So then, the other option would be to work in industry. I would most likely be working for defense contractors or hedge funds, which would feel like selling my soul to the devil. Then there's working for tech companies, which would also kind of crush my soul, I feel. Of course, I can't really tell what I'd like to do now. Like I said, I'm stressing about the future. That's just what I do, lol. 

I could teach high school, but IDK. There's such a stigma surrounding that, and I don't really want to teach unruly teenagers (trust me, I'm one of them). But I could also live pretty much anywhere, which would be neat, I guess. Then there's also the fact that teachers are so underpaid.

"Given 6 people, each one give off 3 votes for a pizza place (of 6), what is a probability of one pizza place to get 6 votes?",1610205623,"Scenario:

 - They want to choose a restaurant, they have 6 pizza places to choose from
 - Each person gets 3 votes, and they need to cast one vote for one pizza place

How to calculate the probability of an even occuring: one concrete pizza place (let's say pizza hut) is given all (6) votes?

I reckon: If 3 people have 3 votes out of 6 places, then a given pizza place (pizza hut) has 50% of getting hit (3 votes out of 6). Each person casts their votes, looks like it's 0.5^6 which is around 1%. Is that correct?

Now, the real question. What is probability of a given place (pizza hut) gets 5 or 6 votes (at least 5). I can't just say 0.5^5, because that would mean ""first 5 people"", but the 5 people voting can be any combination, so the chance is higher than 0.5^5, right?

How much fluff can be removed from textbooks?,1610180303,"No idea if this is the ideal place to post this. I've been looking around the internet either for answers, or for a healthy dose of reality should I turn out to be looking at this naively, and haven't had luck so far.

&amp;#x200B;

I've long observed that, depending on the book, anywhere from a small to a large number of pages in any textbook simply don't need to be there. 

&amp;#x200B;

Definitions, theorems, proofs, explanations, and commentary, which I assume make up the bulk of what we are expected to know, might take up about half of the book. I take no issue with these. There are usually plenty of exercises and examples that I believe don't need to number in the 90s per chapter, especially when loads of exercises and their solutions are available on the internet for free, no solution manual required. And lastly, unrelated imagery, overly stylistic choices, and historical context (which I believe is important, but it's nothing that we couldn't get from the internet) add even more fluff to books. 

&amp;#x200B;

These factors all make books harder to navigate and more expensive, and from my own experiences and given the experiences of my peers, the notes we end up taking are usually limited to the ""definitions, theorems, proofs, explanations, and commentary"" which take up a fraction of the pages that the entire book is written in. Is there anything that can be done about textbook fluff? Or can somebody change my mind and convince me that what those extra pages bring entirely justifies the book size (and cost)?

&amp;#x200B;

The central limit theorem - simulations using Python,1610069266,"The central limit theorem (CLT) forms the basis of the probability distribution. It is being widely used to infer something or make predictions from gathered data.

In January 1801 astronomers discovered Ceres, however, after 6 weeks no one can observe it. Find it again was tricky since 6 week’s data is not enough to draw the orbit, as we know now 6 weeks is only 2% of Ceres’ period of revolution. Furthermore, people know that this 2 week’s data has all kinds of errors. To find Ceres again seems mission impossible since we need to predict the orbit using insufficient data. But it won’t stop a lot of people from trying. To find it we need to calculate the orbit, to calculate the orbit we need first deal with the data with errors. Although scientists know that errors should be in a range and less possible for the big error. But what if we add up all kind of errors what will happen no one knows.

At that time, 24-year-old Carl Friedrich Gauss had been experimenting with mathematical methods for which he would later become famous. Based on his assumption of the error frequency, one formula fits the hypothesis that is, later on, known as the formula of normal distribution.

When he applied those methods to Ceres, he came up with different predictions for its position than most other astronomers... and he was right!

Based on Gauss’s work 9 years later French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace first proved the standard version of the central limit theorem which states that even if a distribution is strongly non‐normal, its sampling distribution of means will be approximately normal for large sample sizes. The central limit theorem reveals the emerging mechanism of the normal distribution also explained the ubiquity of the normal distribution. It makes it possible to use probabilities associated with the normal curve to answer questions about the means of sufficiently large samples.

To fully appreciate this theorem, let’s do some simulations using Python

I will create random samples of numbers 1 to 100, each of size n=500. Then, I will run this simulation multiple times and see whether the sample means distribution resembles a Normal distribution.

What have I stumbled across here?,1610036111,"I know that this is very basic maths/geometry and product rule for counting but i thought it was interesting to apply. 

To calculate the number of outcomes in a game of rock paper scissors with more than 3 variables, eg rock paper scissors gun, you could consider it as four points in 2d space.

Each point connects to another with two lines: One is a winning line (eg rock—&gt;paper wins, paper—&gt;rock loses). Just imagine two lines going to each point with arrows at opposite ends, one being the winning line and one being the losing line.

Ok, we have a square, sort of. But there’s an issue: there are two points that aren’t connected: top left/bottom right, top right/bottom left. So, using the two arrows, connect them both.

We know that n(n-3)/2=the number of diagonals, so a square has two diagonals. But since we’re using the two arrows to connect each point, we would just see how many sets of two arrows there are and times them together. 
Consider the four naturally connected points: 2x2x2x2=8. Now add on the two extras, the diagonals, to get 12. So you have a game with four variables which has 12 outcomes.

For a game with five variables, you could use a regular pentagon. 5(5-3)/2=5 diagonals. Thus, it has 2 lots of 5 sides, which is 10, and two lots of 5 diagonals, which is also 10, to give 20 outcomes. 

For a seven sided shape, you have 7(4)/2=14 diagonals. (7x2)+(14x2)=14+28=42.

so the pattern goes: 12–&gt;20–&gt;42. And so a game with, say, 12 variables, would go:
12(12-3)/2= 54. (12x2)+(54x2)=24+108= 132.

Zero: A Quantitative figure or a Qualitative figure?,1610030373,"It would be fairly obvious to say that in mathematics we deal with quantities, that is, numbers representing concrete quantities undergoing operations such as addition, subtraction, etc (you name it). But I have been wondering lately what exactly is Zero. It clearly can't be a quantitative figure in the strictest sense of the term. I can point to a bunch of pomegranates and say ""that's three pomegranetes"". I can raise my open palm against the sun and say ""that's five fingers"". But what am I really pointing to when I say ""that's zero""? Quite literally, nothing! It's just mere absence, but mere absence that isn't quantified. There are no quantities involved in me saying something is Zero. If anything, it is the lack of quantities which makes me say something is Zero. For instance, I may have one Ramones T-Shirt at a given point in time which in an a later point I give to my friend. So, here I would say ""I had one Ramones T-Shirt, now i have got none"". It is the prior experience of having one which causally connected to my current state makes me say ""I have got zero T-shirts"". Basically, it's the context brought about by the past which tells me in the present that something is not there anymore. It should follow from this then that Zero is actually a qualitative figure not a quantitative one. I am not referring to a quantity of certain things when I use Zero. Instead, I am referring to the quality of something not being there.

But, how can we use two different kinds of figures in mathematics as if they are of the same kind, the same genus, if you will. Now, this is where it becomes really interesting because in our mathematics we add, subtract and do all kinds of things with Zero. Here I am not referring to the usage of zeros in representing quantities such as, for instance, 1000. That is more a matter of how we have set up our decimal system and therefore a matter of representation, not of actually using the figure Zero. I am narrowing in on common mathematical statements such as 1+0=1. This here may seem nothing alarming and like a perfectly coherent statement. I ask though what quantity is really added to 1? I have 1 apple and if I wanted to add a Zero to it, what am I adding really? Same goes with other operations such as subtraction or multiplication. A very interesting way which clearly indicates something's up is when we divide a quantity by Zero. We quite explicitly call it undefined (at best) or having no meaning (at worst). This should be enough to tell us that something is fishy, that using two different kinds of figures as if they belong to one may indeed be syntactically incompatible. What are your thoughts?

How to determine if Stock Price change is significant?,1609997241,"This is not homework. I am a grown man. :D

If we have a stock with price $10, and 3 units of time later (lets say 3 days later), the price is $15.

This is a 50% increase. WOAH!

If the same stock had increased from $500 to $505, this would be an 1% increase. Meh.

The change in price is still the same between each, but the latter looks very bland.

**QUESTION:** Assuming I have the ""average range"" or other similar metric (share your thoughts there if you think I am off-target) that a stock moves per day (unit of time), how can I calculate price change ""significance"" between unit of time A, and unit of time B?

P.S. This is not a question about the stock market per-se and that rabbit hole, but the application of math to 'solve' my dilemma. Approach should work with huge numbers as well as tiny fractional numbers etc. I'm struggling here.

How many programming skills are expected from a mathematician that is planning to enter the job market?,1609973991,"I'm more or less and the end of my [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). (planning to graduate around the end of summer / beginning of fall), so I guess I have to start looking for jobs in the next couple of months. I'm afraid about one thing though: everybody talks about the importance of coding skills nowadays, and I have no idea whether I'm proficient enough or not. During my B.Sc. , I attended a CS course on Algorithms &amp; Data structures where we worked with Java, and during my Numerical Analysis course we worked with Matlab, but I don't consider myself an expert in any of this and it's been quite a long time anyways. I also attended a Computer engineering course where we programmed some stuff too. I'd consider myself decent in Python which I learned on my own, but still, I always feel like an idiot when working on something. Like, I couldn't imagine doing a job where I have to do a lot of Python stuff from day 1 because I'm afraid that people expect something from me that I simply can't deliver. I'm a mathematician after all, not a coding expert.

My [M.Sc](https://M.Sc). mostly revolved around Probability Theory and Statistics, and I also attended a ML course. Writing my thesis in Multivariate Statistics. Will people expect me to be a knowledgeable in Data Science and AI and stuff because of that? Do they expect me to easily write ML algorithms? Because I can't.

I'd say I have some basic or even decent programming skills, but that's it. I don't have a GitHub profile with three dozens of side projects that I developed over the last couple of years, but in todays world I somehow get the feeling that this is pretty much the standard that a mathematician should be able to deliver.

The normal “n choose k” which uses the factorial is then a special case in which a,b / Z- just as the factorial is to gamma.

The authors of the letter mentioned that the human rights organization Memorial recognizes Azat as a political prisoner and recalled that in 1982 the International Congress in Warsaw was postponed for a year due to political prisoners in Poland.

The International Congress of Mathematicians ([ICM](https://icm2022.org/)) is the most significant meeting in pure and applied mathematics, and one of the oldest scientific congresses. The next congress is to take place in 2022 in St. Petersburg. The International Congress awards the Fields Medal, one of the most prestigious awards in mathematics. The signatories include several Fields Medal winner from previous years, including Peter Scholze, who received the Fields Medal at the previous congress in Brazil in 2018.

"Question about the importance of topology, real analysis and differential equations in financial mathematics",1609895875,"Hi, I'm a last year undergrad student looking to pursue math at a graduate level focusing more on financial mathematics. 

Having that in mind, will there be any issues with me now knowing any topology or higher level analysis (such as Fourier and Laplace transformations, gamma function properties, differential equations)?

We unfortunately haven't covered any of these topics during the three years of study here (at least during the courses that were mandatory).

As far as I know, topology and higher level analysis could be useful in measure theory which is a useful thing to understand if you work with stochastic processes used for option pricing. Besides that, I've heard that differential equations can be very useful but I'm not sure where as I'm not that informed on the topic.

"Hear me out... slap-cooking. (this is math related, trust me)",1609892717,"First and foremost, it should be noted that this question is a very stupid and silly one, but after spending a few hours trying to figure out how to scale time to heat (explanation below) and use the friction formula and a few other things I ran into one small hiccup: I suck at math and have literally no idea what I am doing, but after all this time I'm pretty devoted to answering a joking question my friend asked me.

At 1:00 in the morning he sent a text reading,  ""if physical energy can be turned into thermal how hard should I slap a chicken to cook it?"" So I ask you, kind people of r/math, how hard *would* a chicken--assuming it just doesn't have any feathers--need to be slapped in order to cook it.

Let's say the part of the chicken being slapped has a surface area of two square inches. If it takes approximately 1¾ to 2 hours to grill a chicken \[1.875 hours avg. for equation\] that weighs 5 pounds at a temperature of 375°F, how much friction would it take to cook the slapped area to produce the same end result as what I just described. 

Because I am pretty sure the surface area of a chicken's skin's exterior is needed, and definitely not something that can just be googled (I tried) or otherwise searched without extreme effort and finding the actual answer to *this* question would probably result in flayed chickens, lets just say a chicken's skin has a surface area of 1 foot and 7 inches. This is the result of eyeballing it with one of my own chickens, *way* to much guessing, and poor spatial reasoning, so take it with a grain of salt.

And lastly, to all those out there who would devote time and effort into alleviating the stupid of idiotic questions: thank you, and the best of luck.  


P.S. I do not intend to slap any chickens unless it is done purely in self-defense, and good people if it comes to that I will already be dead.",math,Mnemba,False,/r/math/comments/krbuix/hear_me_out_slapcooking_this_is_math_related/

Do I even like math?,1609874677,"Hi. I'm a 17 year old who has, for the past 3 or so years, wanted to be a mathematician. But I'm starting to question if it's really what I want in life. I find math really interesting, sure, but it seems all other aspiring mathematicians my age live and breathe the subject. It seems everyone else is able to think of interesting problems and solve them. I used to be like that. I taught myself a lot in middle school and early high school and am currently trying to learn abstract algebra after about a year of not learning anything new in math, but I feel so behind compared to other aspiring mathematicians my age, who all seem to be so passionate about math that they've done research. 

  The thing is, I do not ""live and breathe"" math. I like a whole lot of subjects from math to sociology, but I'm not really *that* passionate about any of them. I kinda just like to learn cool things. Math, for instance, is just something I see as a cool thing I can spend my life doing full time if I work hard enough. A job consisting of thinking about interesting problems and teaching the next generation of problem-solvers seems awesome. But math is not even on my mind that much, I mostly just think about other topics like anthropology or something. 

   I think this is because I kind of avoid thinking about math. This is a bit personal, but I have struggled with depression since I was 10, and it got *really* bad a few years ago, which was conveniently the time around which I began taking math more seriously. When this happened, I could not read about math without hating myself for being so ""stupid"" as to not understand something, and I would often end the reading session with thoughts of suicide. Since then, I have had math anxiety. Every time I try to learn math, I feel like I can't breathe. Whenever I do math, I cannot erase the feeling of not being good enough.

   And then there's the fact that I'm not particularly good at math. Like I said, I'm trying to learn abstract algebra, but I can't imagine doing well on a test over it like I would have to do in college. And don't even ask me to try to do well on a math competition. So I'm quite behind other aspiring mathematicians my age, it seems. I can confirm this, as I went to a summer program for high schoolers ""gifted"" in math, and I was so intimidated by everyone there that I ended up not making any friends. I have no idea how I got into that program, my answers to the admissions quiz were god awful.

&amp;#x200B;

I still find math fascinating, but with these things considered, I'm not sure I should continue pursuing it.

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Toen's exposition suddenly switches to the derived category of QCoh at this point. I am at a loss as to why would a geometer switch to chain complexes of modules and what does it grant him/her?

Squeeze-fitting a curve by concentric contours of an ellipse-quadratic form,1609811926,"In the paper [""A fast normal random number generator""](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.544.5806) by Leva 1992, they improve an algorithm for generating normal random numbers (given uniform random numbers as input) by significantly reducing the computational overhead with approximation curves.

The original algorithm worked by having 2 curves that are ""easy to compute"" and that bounded from above and below, the function y = 2x √(-ln x) in the interval [0,1]. Since it involves computing a logarithm, the idea is that the bounding curves be simpler to compute, and that the closer they are to the exact function, the better.

The aforementioned paper achieves the breakthrough by using a pair of (concentric) contours of the same quadratic form: an ellipse from inside Q(x,y) = r_1, and an ellipse from outside Q(x,y) = r_2. The ellipses are ""*optimal in that they are an equal ripple quadratic fit to the boundary*"". i.e. When you plot Q(x, 2x √(-ln x)), r_1 and r_2 are the min and max values and are (roughly speaking) equally around the average.

**My question is**: How do they obtain the parameters of this pair of optimal ellipses? What kind of objective function/minimization is taking place here?

For reference, the quadratic form (family of ellipses) is: Q(x,y) = (x-s)^2 + a(y-t)^2 - b(x-s)(y-t). The ""snug"" fit is just so good. If you want to plot in Desmos, the paramaters they obtain are:
s = 0.449871, t = -0.386595
a = 0.19600, b = 0.25472
r_1 = 0.27597, r_2 = 0.27846

Note: if a,b,s,t were determined first, it's easy to see how to obtain r_1 and r_2 numerically; but I don't know if that's how they did it, or whether (more likely) that all 6 parameters were produced together.",math,WobblyKitten,False,/r/math/comments/kqnthc/squeezefitting_a_curve_by_concentric_contours_of/

How useful is category theory for the average mathematician?,1609781393,"Preface: I don't mean to bash on category theory (CT); I fancy some of the concepts myself.

It seems to me that category theory is slowly replacing quantum mechanics in pop science as something notoriously difficult to grasp. You even see programmers spewing ridiculous monad tutorials all the time. I just want to hear from a wider audience how much categories are useful in research in different areas of mathematics.

Just to be clear, I know you can form a category out of most structures studied in algebra, topology, analysis, geometry, probability and whatnot. Doing this may even be beneficial for intuition. For example, it is shown [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/814398/229174) that free Banach spaces cannot exist. Finding a universal property for Haar measures may or may not make us appreciate the Haar measures better. But neither of those results seem to be important to the corresponding field.

I am aware of [HoTT](https://homotopytypetheory.org/) and of the importance of categorical tools in certain fields like algebraic topology (I've even heard that CT actually originated from algebraic topology). I created this post with the intention of having a wide discussion of how useful is CT in mathematics as a whole. This is a large topic so here are a few concrete questions:

* How many of you have actually used a theorem of CT for proving results in your field?
* Do you think that CT should become a required course for pure math undergraduates?

A Question on Biomathematics - Basic Reproduction Number and it's Relation to Equilibria Points,1609729700,"First off, i am a beginner at math and especially on this topic. So don't be shocked, if the following question is stupid as it certainly sounds stupid to me. 

The following [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871801/) gives a nice tutorial on how to caculate R_{0} via the Next-Generation-Matrix-Method. R_{0} lesser than 1 (stable) or strictly greater than 1 implies the stability of the infection-free equilibrium. Well, what's my issue then? To prove this relation in a specific model one has to show that the Eigenvalues of the Jacobian-Matrix at the infection-free state have all negative real part, if R_{0} is lesser than 1 and otherwise not. The trouble i am running into is the following: R_{0} is defined as the contact rate times the infectious period. Imagine a simple SIR-Model. You now have R_{0} = \frac{\alpha}{\delta}, where \alpha := the contact rate and \delta := infectious period. You also deterime trace and determinant of the 2 by 2 Jacobian and find a term \alpha N - \delta which has to be strictly lesser than zero so that det &gt;0 and tra &lt; 0 hold true. Rearranging \alpha N - \delta &lt; 0 gives 1 &lt; \frac{\alpha N}{\delta}, wich almost implies the wished relation between R_{0} and stability but cause of the N doesn't quite holds true and you would have to assume that N = 1. Maybe that is the preassumption of the models i am doing anyway with terms like \alpha SI describing the epidemiological birth of new infected individuals. I suspect this as there are other models which assume this term to be \alpha S \frac{I}{N}. Another confusing thing is that while in Murray's Mathematical Biology 1 R_{0} is defined as above in Mathematical Models in Epidemiology it is indeed defined as R_{0}, but times N the population size. With this definition i could prove, but this seemingly contradicts multiple papers and a textbook. I haven't seen this difference explained directly. It probably has a good reason e.g. that N the population size if constant equals one because of simplicity or that in models with N not being constant R_{0} depends on population size.

If you could give me clarity on this one thing it would really help a lot as i need it for more difficult models like SEIR with birth and deaths as well.",math,LuazuI,False,/r/math/comments/kpzshw/a_question_on_biomathematics_basic_reproduction/

My way to seeing reality &amp; everything in a meta-mathematical way: The universal framework of master infinities as invisible frameworks &amp; are infinite as opposed to summative integers which are paradoxes as they they are both finite due of summation &amp; infinite due to expansion &amp; evolution,1609719429,"By Nodar Nogaideli (don't steal and give references if you express these ideas. Follow academic integrity (sorry I'm just easily paranoid))

Everything in a spectrum is a paradox. Integers are in a spectrum. 'Master Infinities' i.e. universal mediators of integers (integers as synonyms for variables / aspects / elements of reality) so these are master infinite numbers like pi and phi cannot be a paradox and this is why they are very special and is the main difference between normal finite integers. Jewish mysticism  and Egyptian and Greek mathematics knew about these numbers before they were officially posited and theorised in modern times. And due to their times, they saw these numbers as God. A force that spans in every dimension that exist like a wavelength. Modern misinterpretation of ancient works like Hermeticism or original Old Testament is due to language problems which can cause misinterpretation as the same words they sued they meant to paint a different 'picture' of meaning and significance. People who have read Ludwig Wittgenstein know about the language-meaning problem. And Wittgenstein's work is very mathematic but math is applied to expressionism of sentience and the disconnection of what we are trying to say and get across to what we can get across as the things we are thinking might not have the suitable words to be able to get across, but we still have to use words that already exist and this can cause misinterpretation. These people back then didn't have the mathematic terminology we have now.

Now, integers are finite because they are summation of the fractional infinity that came before. so say 0.x travelling up to 1, as fractional infinity crosses into a 'new thing', a singularity. The fractality as law also dictates an infinite number of cross of singularities, so this one is the higher dimensional singularity and expansion of fractions towards it and there is a lower dimensional version of the same thing inside the 'body' or spectrum of that higher dimensional integer. So in the fractional breakdown of the higher dimensional singularity, exist lower dimensional singularities with their own fractional infinities evolving towards a singularity. Hence fractals, and I'm gonna coin a phrase 'integer infinity' which is a synonym for fractality but give different connotations so to illuminate a different way of seeing it for the purpose of understanding.

Life (reality) is a intersection of many variables and aspects. This is governed by a mathematic framework underneath our reality. This framework or 'grid', is invisible it only exists because things that actually exist like energy and matter, needs to occupy this infinite space. If only variable / aspect / element there wouldn’t be a reality. The reason why the world exists is due to the interaction of the separate variables / aspects / elements. Imagine variables / aspects / elements as 2D spectrums, a 2D square graph, like paper, or you know the colour spectrum for each different shade of colour in photoshop. Now imagine them on top of each other like a stack of papers. The inter-fuse, have a chemical reaction together, 'breed', the same mechanism of action as intercourse. And now imagine the stack of papers becoming smaller as they fuse, and until all of them embedded and encoded in only one piece of paper. Reality is then created. All these spectrums So all elements are spectrums separate from each other (these are represented by integers and fractional infinity, as actual things that exist) is mediated by master infinities, like pi and phi. Normal integers can stop in their tracks, they are summations of infinites before themselves, like one human is a billion of cells, so then one human can be expressed and be called the same thing as billions of cells. There is no difference. Evolution is then expanding the value of this integer. Hence numbers are relative and are only representations, as one exists in every dimension and mathematic, but one in a higher dimension is a bigger value than one in the dimension below. So what is the purpose of these master infinities, these 'special' infinites like pi and phi? They don't really exist, the only exist in actuality but as an invisible force. They are what fuse all separate aspects and variables together so all these elements can come together to make new things, to manifest new things and bring upon reality, like how a human has an elemental breakdown of what we are made up of, as is everything in the universe has elemental breakdown of its make-up and properties. The universal master infinites traverse all the dimensions in a wavelength. This is how all dimensions are connected to each other and how a cause and effect in each dimension (the 'divine spark' which is an event) can travel and effect every other corner of existence in every dimension. So everything you do has an effect in all parts of the mathematic formula that is reality. The master infinites create a 'golden vortex' where all the separate spectrums come together in a cubic spectrum where it houses all the chemical reaction of all separate elements as they form reality through their fission / fusion of each other. So all spectrums then become this one spectrum, this one piece of paper in 2D, a cube in 3D and etc in every dimension. In the centre is the singularity, the portal to the higher dimension. Fractality is also a law of nature, and these exist in lower dimensional singularities in other parts of master spectrum of the cube, where pi and phi also form lower dimensional singularities, and thus higher dimensional and lower dimension fission / fusion / intercourse exist and is also a law of nature.

"Integer valued recurrence relation bounded s.t. 1 &lt;= a(n) &lt; = n, OEIS",1609706314,"This is a weird one:  


**a(n) = n + 1 - a(ϕ(n))**

This sequence goes all over the place. Like the totient function (ϕ(n)), only worse. The ""+ 1"" is by design since it actually guarantees that a is an integer sequence. Without this increment, the sequence becomes half odd integer and even negative at times.

By strong induction, it is possible to prove that 1 &lt;= a(n) &lt;= n. Since the Euler phi/totient function has a maximum of n - 1 whenever n is a prime, a(ϕ(n)) is &lt;= a(n - 1), which is really convenient for induction, as well as dynamic programming,   


Here is Python code for computing the sequence:  


`from sympy import totient as phi`

&amp;#x200B;

`N = 100`

&amp;#x200B;

`# a(n) = n + 1 - a(phi(n)), n &gt; 0`

`a = [ 0 ] * N`

&amp;#x200B;

`# a(1) = 1 + 1 - a(phi(1)) = 2 - a(1) =&gt; 2 a(1) = 2 =&gt; a(1) = 1`

`# a(n), n &gt; 1 computed using dynamic programming`

&amp;#x200B;

`a[1] = 1`

`for n in range(2, N):`

	`a[n] = n + 1 - a[phi(n)]`

	`assert(a[n] &gt; 0)`

	`assert(a[n] &lt;= n)`

`print(a[1:])`

`Function[, If[#1 == 1, 1, # + 1 - #0[EulerPhi@#]], Listable]@Range[70]`

Could you use maze solving algorithms to do proofs?,1609704584,"I have very little experience in this, so please feel free to let me know if this idea is nonsense. However, I had this thought earlier that doing proofs seems analogous to going through a maze. For example, say you want to prove ""If A then B.""

You can do this by taking (A) and applying some logic or some theorem to obtain statement (C). You can then apply some logic or theorem to obtain statement (D), etc. Eventually you would get to (B). However, you can apply many theorems or logical operations to a statement. For example, if you take a true statement (C), theorem T\_1 may imply that ""if C then C\_1,"" theorem T\_2 may imply that ""if C then C\_2,"" etc. In this way, it seems like if you consider a maze, logic and theorems seem analogous to straight paths while true statements seem analogous to turns/intersections. We have many algorithms used to solve mazes, so would it be possible to use them to do proofs taking into account what was in this post?

Anti-damped harmonic oscillator,1609696259,"Hi everyone!

Where d is a **positive** coefficient representing the strength of the damping. This equation has a ton of properties and is used everywhere in physics. 

I am interested especially in the dynamical properties of the solution: being a damped equation, one can show that the solution decays exponentially. Usually, in the literature, the next step is to add other dissipative/conservative mechanisms to the equation and to study what happens to the solution.

"Are mathematicians as ""bold"" as they used to be?",1609680121,"Mathematicians of the past were often very bold when grappling with the infinite and dealt with problems related to infinitely large and small quantities in ways that don't hold up to todays standard of rigor.

Trying to find the correct ways of reasoning about these problems helped build classical analysis which was a big accomplishment but I feel like it was by being bold that mathematicians discovered new ways of solving challenging problems and the role of rigor was only to show the limitations of their methods.

Today mathematics students are taught the dangers of using these methods carelessly and how to be as rigorous as possible. This made me wonder whether today mathematicians are ""afraid"" to use seemingly wrong but helpful methods (like the ones listed above) which they can't explain and whether this prevents them from creating new tools for solving problems. A related question is whether mathematicians are guided by their concern for rigor or whether they use rigorous arguments once they think they have a novel idea that needs a security check.

I'm thinking of using [Measure, Integration, and Real Analysis](https://measure.axler.net) by Sheldon Axler (he also wrote [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://linear.axler.net)), but if there are better suggestions I would be open to them. It's not too long, about 400 pages. I'm mainly looking to have a good background of measure theory so I can get into probability theory and stochastic calculus; a good book for this (I think) is [Probability: Theory and Examples](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~biskup/275a.1.20f/PDFs/Durrett-v5.pdf) by Rick Durrett. Again, I'm open to suggestions.

Because of COVID all of my classes were online this semester, and the quality was quite horrible, so I pretty much taught myself most of the material. And while I'm kind of annoyed about the quality of the classes, in a way it was good because it highlighted some deficiencies I have with self-learning, mainly in the sense of me losing motivation often (I guess I relied too heavily on my good professors during undergrad), and I need (and want!) to improve. I don't want to have too strict of a deadline, but having a timeframe to teach myself something will hopefully help me stick to it. 

My question is, for people who spend a lot of time studying on their own, how long does it usually take you? I know this isn't a well-posed question, since (at least for me) you can always learn more about a topic, so more specifically I want to know how long it takes you to really learn the *fundamentals* of a topic when studying on your own.",math,akenny430,False,/r/math/comments/kpd42n/how_long_does_it_take_to_finish_a_book_on_your_own/

Math curriculum at a Peruvian university,1609643361,"Hi everyone, I'm a peruvian HS student and I would like to study abroad, but I'm still researching my possibilities here. So here I bring you the PUCP (Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú) math curriculum for you to review it. 

This is a five year program. 

The first two years are done in what is called ""general science studies"", which includes intro physics courses, single and multivariable calculus, a proof writing class, and two ""fundamentals of analysis"" classes.

Here is the description for the last 3 years as I understand it, together with the course descriptions: 

&amp;#x200B;

 Third Year:

**Probability and stats 1:**

Probability models. Random variables. Distribution of random variables. Transformations of random variables. Limit distributions. Central limit theorem. Sample distributions. Point and interval estimation.

**Applied Diffeq:**  
 Methods for solving ordinary and partial differential equations. Differential equations ordinary first order. Linear differential equations. Solution of equations using Laplace transform. Solutions using Taylor series. Partial Differential Equations and Applications

**Real Analysis 1**: Structures, derivation, integration, curves and surfaces (in R\^n)

**Linear Algebra:**

Linear programming: assignment problems, detransportation, inventory, replacement. Sensitivity analysis. Dynamic programming. Applications tomodels and simulation. PERT / CPM techniques. Resource usage calendar.  

**Real Analysis 2**: Intro measure theory, lebesgue integral etc. 

**Numerical Calculus**: 

Numerical solution of nonlinear equations. Numerical linear algebra. Interpolation andapproximation of functions. Numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations 

**Algebra 2** (Algebra 1 is linear algebra):

Students are introduced to the main algebraic structures: semigroups, groups, rings, bodies and vector spaces from the number systems N, Z, Q, R and C, and from the vector space of R2. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fourth Year: 

**Operations Research 2:**

  Queueing theory: basic structure. Distributions of waiting time and service time.Equipment replacement and maintenance theory: discrete and continuous time analysis. Analysis in probabilistic regime. Network analysis and dynamic programming. Nonlinear programming.

**Algebra 3:** 

Field Theory. Modules and exact sequences of modules. 

**PDEs:**

**Geometry** (I assume this is differential geometry) :

The geometry of the Gauss map. The intrinsic geometry of surfaces. 

**Topology**:

General topology and, briefly, algebraic topology

**3 Elective classes from the following list:** 

Harmonic Analysis 

Game theory and decision theory

Regression analysis 

Probability and stats 2 (economic and financial applications mostly)

"What makes this ""proof"" incorrect? Help! It's keeping me up at night!",1609641978,"For background, senior CS major that took some math for fun. Engineering math mostly (diff eq, 3d calc), but also real analysis and number theory.

There is a bijection between base 10 and base 11 integers. So, equivalent sets with different symbols.

The final symbol in the base 11 set is 'A', like in hexadecimal.

We take the subset of the base 11 set where 'A' occurs at most once, and not as the first or last digit.

We make a new set out of this subset by interpreting all members as a string of abstract symbols and ditch the numeric interpretation.

We rewrite all 'A' as '.' in this new set, and reinterpret the symbols as floating point numbers.

Now interpret this as a set of floating point numbers. By construction / grammar, this is the set of real numbers. During our rewrite we didn't add or remove any members from the subset of integers, so apparently the set of real numbers is smaller than the set of integers.

Seriously, this won't stop bothering me. Obviously the set of real numbers is actually larger. So, perhaps this is not a valid way to reason about the sizes of infinitely large sets?",math,okovko,False,/r/math/comments/kpbww4/what_makes_this_proof_incorrect_help_its_keeping/

If we were to do it this way then dividing something by zero would be the logical opposite of multiplying something by zero (10\*0=0, vs 10/0=10). could any math people of reddit explain to me why we don't use the latter method of division?",math,Dragonking00o7,False,/r/math/comments/kouej6/on_the_nature_of_dividing_by_zero_are_we_doing_it/

Textbook recommendations for noncommutative geometry,1609539716,"Hey math world of reddit!

One year ago, I got a masters degree at my university in mathematics, and I feel that I deeply miss the challenges of studying problems and the pure joy of understanding a new concept. The monotonicity of the lockdown now inspired me to start a new math project, in a field of mathematics I know almost nothing of: Noncommutative geometry! My only source on it is the wikipedia article for now, but I am really intrigued. This is not for academic purposes, I solely want to educate myself for the sake of it.

My background is:
- basics in algebraic topology
- a little more than the basics in algebraic geometry, but I am in no way an expert ( I wrote my thesis in that field, but I for example really had to look up again what an étale morphism is )
- basics of functional analysis, so I for example know what a C*-algebra is, but I have no idea about the Gelfand representation.


Are there any books for noncommutative geometry for my background? If not, what would you recommend that I need to teach myself before I understand the basics? Thanks for the help! :)",math,UntrustworthyKitten,False,/r/math/comments/koki8s/textbook_recommendations_for_noncommutative/

Intuition regarding part of Newton Divided Difference Interpolation for Polynomials with Degree Higher than One,1609369782,"Using this [link](http://mathforcollege.com/nm/mws/gen/05inp/mws_gen_inp_txt_ndd.pdf) as a reference (start bottom of pg 4 of pdf), I understand the process, but enjoy translating things to intuitive words. 

For example, how we can talk about slope as rate of change and ""rise over run"". 

My main concern is when we get to the quadratic case and as we are building up the interpolation we find the ""rise over run"" in the parabolic case to be a difference between slopes (average differences at two different sets of points or the secant line). In terms of formula:

f(b) - f(a) / b - a 

or using the document:

b2 = (f(x2) - f(x1) / x2 - x1) - (f(x1) - f(x0) / x1 - x0) / x2 - x0 

My main concern is what the b2 slope is multiplied by:

(x - x0)(x - x1) 

Now, in the linear case, linear slope (b1) is more intuitive because you see the average rate of change (rise of run) multiplied by the run (x-x0), where x = x1, to get the amount needed to rise for that amount of run from f(x0). It also defines a zero at x0 which says ""hey if we are at x0, we aren't rising any"". 

Returning back to the parabolic case, the zeroes make sense like how we learn to factor polynomials. When x is x0 or x1 there is no effect of b2. However, is there a way to interpret that quantity the way in which we interpreted the linear case (i.e. average amount of rise for that amount of run multiples by **amount of run**)?

Or do I have to accept that (x2 - x0)(x2 - x1) doesn't have any meaning outside of defining where this effect is ""turned off"". I'm hoping some people can also point to historical documents or other resources since I'm big on wanting to build this for the ground up.

&amp;#x200B;

""Arlene has just turned age 58 and retired. She has a balance of $585,000 in her investment account, and would like to pay herself an income on the first of each month. Further, Arlene would like to leave an inheritance to her granddaughter when she dies. Therefore, rather than deplete her assets, Arlene would like to ensure there is a balance of $100,000 remaining after 30 years to provide the inheritance to her granddaughter. Arlene assumes that she can earn a nominal investment return of 5.5%, compounded annually.

Assuming a life expectancy to age 90, what amount can Arlene pay herself each month? Round your answer to the nearest dollar.""  


I can't wrap my head around why PV is NEGATIVE and FV is positive according to answer book? I keep thinking PV and FV are both positive since this is HER money , she is just trying to reduce from 585k to 100k?

Four corner bingo problem,1609348661,"In classic bingo, a player wins by filling in squares in either a row, column, or diagonal. Some people like to play bingo where you can win by filling in the four corners, and I was wondering if this could mathematically fit the requirements of a classic win.

Way to write modulus math as a series summation,1609344959,"Hey all,

I’m doing a side project with python (the Advent Of Code challenges) and recently I ran across a problem that I’m trying to optimize. Essentially I have to test a changing number, say `x`, for being evenly divisible by 7, `x%7==0`. If it is, I then divide `x` by 7 until not evenly divisible by 7, add a number, say `y`, until `(x + y)%7==0` and repeat. 

I have this notion for some reason that if I can “compress” the modulus into a summation, I can then “compress” that summation into a discrete function (almost like how sin(x) can be represented as an infinite series, except that the series for my purpose would be finite).

I figured that if I can “compress” an easy modulus function, like

`x%2==0 -&gt; sum(n=0 to x) (-1)^x`

Where 1 is true and 0 is false, since finite

It could be possible to “compress” another modulo into series summation (like 7). 

I’ve been searching the internet for if it’s been proven impossible or possible either way, and alas nothing. I’d love to find a generalized transfer function from modulo to series, but I would be content with just finding a series summation of modulo 7.

I've seen better explanations, but I can't find the answer to why the formula works that way. So then I researched solving quadratic equations using factoring to try to get a deeper understanding. I'm reading up on that, and it all makes sense, and then they mention the ""sum product pattern"". Now I try to understand why that works, but can't find an explanation or proof for why that works.

It seems like I'm supposed to memorize these formulas without questioning them, and that is something that really frustrates me (especially considering my job requires me to do the opposite).

( https://youtu.be/Q1AXfOr6W4k )

It's about people saying that to master a skill, you need 10,000 hours in that skill. I wanted to know how many skills a person could learn while still living their life. So I did a bunch of math. 

The thing is though... I don't know what to call that kind of math. And I don't know how to go about finding out. 

So I'm hoping some of you might be able to read it and tell me what I'm doing? And maybe even show it to me written in that very visual ""math language"" with math symbols and things?? 

I would really like to actually educate myself on this but going out and finding the answer to a question like this is very overwhelming so I figured, if you know and can identify it, that would be so much easier on me otherwise I wouldn't even no where to start.

Anyways, here's the comment I made on the video...

🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈🧁🐈


""10,000 hours is 1 year and 2 months of nonstop consecutive learning. If you live to 100, that's only 86 things you can learn if you did absolutely nothing else in your entire life for that full 100 years. 
But we need to remove a third of that for sleep. Which leaves you with enough time to only learn a maximum of 58 things (at the full 10,000 hour level). 

But what about work? That's a consecutive 24 years nonstop. If you do 8 hours day, 5 days a week and live to 100. That leaves you with only 37 things of 10,000 hours that you're able to do if you do absolutely nothing else. 

But you're gonna wanna eat, bathe, do laundry, and shop. Once a week you might have a date night which means 0 hours spent on your thing on those nights. 

So let's say you dedicate two hours for cooking, eating and cleaning, an hour for grooming, 2 for movies, Netflix, social media etc and then about an hour a week for laundry. 

So that comes to 36 hours a week, 1872 hours a year, 187,200 hours in 100 years,  7,800 days, 260 months (30 day months) or 18.57 10,000 hour things you're no longer able to do because you don't have the time. 

Which means that takes away 18.5 10,000 hour things.... which means at this point you're only able to learn 18 and a half 10,000 hour things. 
And because I forgot to include 52 date nights a year, you have even less than this and I haven't even factored in commute time or vacations yet. All of this is you stay home every night. 

So you can safely live your life and master about 10 things. 
Make those 10 things count. 

P.s. If you know what the different types of math are called that I used to do all this, I'd love to know. I don't know what these equations are called. I just know how to do them. But I'd really love to be able to put a name to it and maybe learn some more kinds like this. 

What I do is take 2 hours a day, times it by 7 for a week.  That's 14 hours. Times that by 52 weeks. That's 728 per year. Times by 100 years. 72,800 hours in 100 years. Now I turn the hours into days. Divide by 24. That's 3,033 full 24 hour days. Divide by 30 to get the months. 101 months. Now divide by 12 and that's how many consecutive years 2 hours of every week is in a 100 year life. 

And that's 8.42 nonstop months. So if you do something weekly for only 2 hours and you live to 100, that's how much of your life you'll spend on it. 

P.s. I like math. I just wish I knew the labels and names for all of it.  Like ""solve for x"" or something.""",math,DannicaK,False,/r/math/comments/kmtac0/i_want_to_know_what_kind_of_math_i_do_i_dont_know/

Idea for union-closed sets conjecture,1609279446,"This probably falls short or has been thought already or something like that, but I'd love to hear something from you all.

This is something I just commented on another post but I doubt many people will see that comment:

&gt;I have one question to anybody. I believe this is correct, but maybe someone can find a counterexample. If it is correct, then the question of the conjecture can be narrowed down significantly. Actually there would be an easy algorithm to find such an element. I have to think it further.

&gt;Can I construct every union-closed set by grabbing a powerset and (possibly) chopping off any instance of an element from a level downwards? (That is if we consider the order by inclusion.)

&gt;[Here's an example of what I mean by ""chopping off"" _b_ from the third level  downwards in the case of the powerset of size 2^4 .](https://ibb.co/Db81yzT)

&gt;(As a note, the ""chopping off"" of the emptyset could be handled separately, but it shouldn't be an issue since if you have an element in half of your sets and the emptyset is one of them, then of course that same element is going to be an element of half of the sets now without the emptyset.)

The ""algorithm"" I mention would be: start from above, and choose whatever element ""survives"" in the ""chopping off process."" This element is in half of the sets since we know that given a powerset any element satisfies being in half of the sets, and we are only taking out sets that don't contain this element, so it's only favourable.

I'm sorry for not being very formal, but this is just an idea I just came up with, and it is quite simple, so I'm doubting greatly of course. Still wanted to hear what you had to say.

The result used however can only to my knowledge be proved by induction, one of the methods that I was discouraged from using.

Implementing implicit numerical methods for coupled ODEs,1609271845,"I'm familiar with using multi-step methods like the Adams Bashford or BDF methods, but how do you implement it if you've got a system of coupled ODEs?

    while (error1 &gt; tolerance)

     Y1[I] =Y1_temp - Function1(Y1_temp, Y2[I-1])/Function1Derivative(Y1_temp, Y2[I-1]);

Am I a genius? I've just come up with a formula lol,1609271250,"I really want to know if I'm a genius or something

This past few weeks I've been trying to add number and I did it manually in a calculator

I thought how can I add consecutive numbers!!  I couldn't find a calculator on Google or a formula or anything!! 

So correct me if I'm wrong

Basically if I want to add

1+2+3+4+5+6-7+8+9+10

I finally thought can't we reverse order from 6 onwards and lay it under. 

That basically means everything equals the same thing *5

So basically all you need to do is take the first and last number and add them together

Then divide the last number by 2

Basically 10+1=11 then 10/2=5

5*11=55

That's basically the answer to 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10

Exploring the space of nice triangle area formulas,1609264857,"Few weeks ago I found a paper in Annals of Mathematics giving 110 formulas for calculating triangle area (*A collection of formulae for the area of a plane triangle* by Marcus Baker). Most of the formulas are given in terms of sides, altitudes, angles, median and angle bisector lengths, and inscribed, circumscribed and escribed circle radii.

Clearly an infinite number of triangle area formulas can be generated without some restrictions in place and I indeed dislike some of the formulas given in the paper, typically those that assume the knowledge of many more quantities than would be necessary. For example:

    Area = 1/2 CubeRoot(a b c h_a h_b h_c)

One would only need any single pair of base and altitude, or maybe only the three sides, to calculate the area, yet the formula contains many more variables. The author probably valued the symmetry of the formula or maybe in some application only the products of side lengths and altitudes are known.

I happily condone the redundancy when it allows for a simpler formula, such as in:

    Area = a b c / (4 R)

where we would do with a, b, c and Heron's formula, but the addition of circumradius shows a beautiful relationship.

I'm interested in exploring the space of triangle area formulas computationally and picking some nice formulas - particularly minimal ones (if any variable used is dropped there is no longer unique area), and then maybe redundant but short and/or symmetric ones.

Is there any theory and computational resources to be known?

My plan is to express the used quantities in coordinates and see if a candidate formula always reduces to a correct triangle area formula using a computer algebra system. Generating candidate formulas should be probably a bit smarter than walking through large swathes of possible expression trees.

How do you read a book about math?,1609261242,"Lately I've gotten used to reading books as a mean of self-study. I have a blast whenever I do so and I do not feel boredom whatsoever. Most books (and all the ones I'm currently reading) present some collection of proofs and problems. The thing is, I can understand the problem, read the proof once or twice, and move on to seek more knowledge.   
But this is not what I want to do. I want to stop and appreciate what's presented, understand what's even going on, imagine what the writer was thinking while creating the proof, and even try using Feynman's studying technique, by trying to re-explain the proof to myself. Obviously all this requires paper, a board, sometimes the internet for help, it can be done while you're on your bed on sitting on a chair!  
As well sometimes there are exercices, and stopping to do them kind of sucks since when I read a book I prefer leaning back for a while with the only action happening is flipping pages.  


These moments where you have to stop reading, and start thinking and moving more extensively, I don't know how to handle.

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past.

If A≠∅ then there exists a function f: {A}=&gt;A such that f(A)€A.,1609216970,"First of all, I apologize for the terrible notation; I'm writing this post using my cellphone. By the way, this is not a homework question.

I was working on a proof that the cartesian product of a finite number of sets is non-empty if and only if each of the factors is non-empty that doesn't make use of the axiom of choice (otherwise the proof would be trivial).

The forward direction follows pretty much from the definition of the cartesian product (at least the one I'm using).

The reverse implication uses induction on the number of factors of the product. And if one doesn't think too hard about what's going on there's nothing strange or even remarkable about the argument itself. However, I decided to take a step back and look closely at the base case (n=1), because I'm *that* obsessed with rigour.

Okay, so if n=1 then we want to show that the cartesian product of A is non-empty given that A is non-empty. If we choose to play dumb and identify the cartesian product of A with A itself then there's nothing to prove because the statement becomes tautological. But the definition I'm using applied to this particular case states that the cartesian product of A is the set of functions with domain 1 (that is, the set of all natural numbers less than 1) and codomain A. So let's roll with that.

Now, A is non-empty, which means that there exists a such that a€A, nothing weird about that. The problem is how to define a function from 1 to A. Again, we could call it a day and simply write ""Choose some element from A, say b, and define f:1=&gt;A by f(0)=b. Base case done and dusted."" But that's exactly what bothers me. Since we don't have a canonical choice for b, aren't we implicitly invoking some form of the axiom of choice? Because, as ridiculous as it sounds, the fact that A is non-empty doesn't seem to imply (formally) that we can single out one of its elements. We know there *is* at least one, but we don't have a way to *choose* one.

I mean, at that level it's almost stupid to even entertain the thought that such a choice is not possible, and normally I wouldn't really give it much thought. But since formal set theory is a thing there must be a way to get around this ""issue"" without ending up in a circular argument.

However this means that I can only take the third sequence the following year in Spring because the class is only offered once a year in Spring. 

For context: (The first sequence is offered in Fall and Winter, I will be taking it in winter)  


My question is should I try to concurrently take the second and third sequence in the upcoming Spring quarter? It just seems that it would be a bad idea either way of waiting a whole year (and probably forgetting many of the theorems) or taking them concurrently (which is a huge commitment). I will be graduating in 2022, so having this class before applying to grad school (although not necessary) could be a good thing  
I understand that studying can take upwards of 12 or more hours outside of lecture, so assuming I have time, what should I do? Any pros and cons, advice, etc would be greatly appreciated",math,ProjectCereal,False,/r/math/comments/km4mhz/advice_for_taking_real_analysis/

Lossless Compression,1609203994,"I saw this explanation of lossless compression on 4chan.

&amp;#x200B;

Take a sequence of 3 numbers that has length L ---&gt; 1/3 + 1/3 + 1/3 = L 

and after a lossless compression algorithm is used that length must remain the same in order to be lossless but this doesn't reduce the file size ----&gt; 1/4 + 1/3 + 5/12 = L &lt;---- one box is compressed and one box is stretched 

Now take any sequence of 5 binary numbers that has length L and try to map this set to the set of any sequence of 6 binary numbers that have a length less than L.

In other words, this is a mapping of a set with 2\^n element(inputs) to a set with 2\^m elements(outputs) where 2\^n &gt; 2\^m.

This leads to a surjective function because there will be at least 2 cases where 2 strings of 5 bits will map to 1 string of 6 bits. This means that there is no way to reverse the function from the output back to the original inputs, therefore there is no way to produce a lossless algorithm that decreases the file size of an image/video, etc.",math,Tak5035,False,/r/math/comments/km3k0e/lossless_compression/
Mapping a sphere on a 2d plain,1609200829,"Hey, recently I came back to an idea I had a while ago about mapping a sphere on a 2d plain and this time I actually tried something but I'm having some problems. My idea is to have a plain go through a semi-sphere and to look at every circle that is created from the intersections where the plain touches the sphere. Then to calculate every circumference of every sphere and ordering them by size, then duplicating and flipping the shape that is created and putting it on the edge of the first shape.
That is my idea however, I'm having some trouble executing it because of these problems:

1: I don't know if every circle from radius 0 to the radius of the sphere will appear if I cut it with a plain, I'm just assuming it will.

2: After I get all the circumferences of the circles, how can I arrange them in a shape. I can't do it by hand because they are infinate, so I have to find a formula that creates that shape.

2. Is it possible to create a line that has 2 limits? For example I want to graph a horizontal line where x is greater than 2 and less than 4, but x is less than 3.5 and greater than 3. I tried doing so on Desmos but it wouldn’t draw the line. The equation I entered:

Separability and Continuity,1609181476,"I've always had a little bit of an issue with the general definition of continuous function for a topological space. We say a function f : X -&gt;Y is continuous if for ever open set U of Y, f^-1(U) is open in X. I  can understand this definition when it comes to metric spaces, but have always had trouble establishing intuition for general topological spaces. 

Then across the concept of [separated sets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separated_sets). Two sets are A and B are ""separated by neighborhoods"" if there are disjoint open sets U and V such that U contains A and V contains B. Using this definition it's not difficult to show that if two sets A and B are _inseparable_  and f is continuous then the images f(A) and f(B) will also be inseparable. 

This seems intuitive to me. A function separating something that was inseparable is ""tearing something apart"" and so discontinuous. It'd be nice if I could think of this as an ""alternative"" definition of continuous. But it's not clear to me whether the converse holds.   That is, if a function satisfies this property does it mean that the function must be continuous? If not, are there any additional reasonable axioms I can add to make them equivalent?",math,Rioghasarig,False,/r/math/comments/klwdq0/separability_and_continuity/

Is Brownian Motion 'Unique'?,1609089571,"So a brownian motion (W_t) is a continuous stochastic process that satisfies a number of conditions. This is defined over some measurable space.

My first question is, what measurable space are brownian motions typically defined on? (I assume some sort of continuous analogue of the canonical infinite product space you would define discrete stochastic processes on)

Secondly, this brownian motion would induce some sort of law on the measure space (after we equip it with some 'canonical' measure). I suppose the question of uniqueness I am asking is if two Weiner processes on the same measure space would induce the same law on it? Or is there some other notion of 'uniqueness' that is more suitable to describe here?

My motivation for asking this is because there are different ways we can construct these brownian motions (eg. taking a discrete symmetric random walk with smaller time intervals and jumps, vs taking a fourier series with random coefficients) and I would like to know if these different constructions will always yield the same result.",math,past-the-present,False,/r/math/comments/kl7bnp/is_brownian_motion_unique/

What are some good resources to learn about the relationships between the most influential mathematicians? (odd topic),1609056471,"So, I'm reading a biography of Georg Cantor for a passion project and I'm noticing that there is an extreme depth of connection between the German mathematicians who were active from the late 1700s through the early 1900s  (a.k.a. the period with the most influence on Cantor's life/work).

This is not necessarily surprising.  Different regions of the world had extreme impacts on mathematics at different points in history.  And, it makes sense that great mathematicians would seek to collaborate with one another.

But, the extent to which these german mathematicians are connected is interesting beyond belief.  I'm going to use ""ep:"" to represent ""epynonm of"" for this next part...

I'm not going to come close to covering the full extent of this, but here goes: Cantor's work was actively opposed by Leopold Kronecker (ep: Kronecker Delta) and former friend Hermann Schwarz (ep: Cauchy-Schwarz inequality).  Schwarz obviously has a loose connection to Cauchy via the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.  Cantor was academically connected to Weierstrass and Kummer.  Additionally, through publications/correspondence Cantor was directly in contact with Poincare (ep: Poincare conjecture), who was a student of  Charles Hermite (ep: Hermite Polynomials), as well as Gosta Mittag-Leffler.  Later in the timeline, we have David Hilbert's first problem being the Continuum Hypothesis, which Cantor dedicated his life to trying to prove.  (Hilbert and Cantor also had significant correspondence).  Not to mention that Cantor recommended Franz Mertens (a teacher of Erwin Schrodinger) for a professorship.. and Cantor was in frequent contact with Felix Klein (ep: Klein bottle).  For a major part of his life Cantor was in close correspondence with Richard Dedekind.  I'm not super familiar with Dedekind, but he was advised by Carl Friedrich Gauss.  And, a direct connection with Gauss means connections with Poisson, Fourier, Riemann, Lipschitz, Lagrange, Euler... Tracing forward, backward, peers, influences, all over the place...

So long question short: are there any resources with good documentation or visualization of all these connections?

Is this a good explanation of what a real number is?,1609038050,"The real numbers are distinct from irrational numbers in many ways. The first being that they create a structure that is random in nature from a seemingly uniform progression of increasing 1 from object x to x + 1.

Even the prime numbers themselves have patterns that are confusing! My favorite is the Polya conjecture that seems to hold but doesn't at a relatively large number  906150257 is the point where this pattern of most integers having more odd number of prime factors shifts to more even number of prime factors. Real numbers take all of the structure of natural numbers and extend it to the gaps placed between the integers. Doing this brings up the notion of irrationality, which states that an object no matter how hard you try can not be expressed with (a/b) for example the sqrt(2) which you learn to prove through assumption and then contradict via the inability to break a fraction down into its coprime state. This is what a real number is, a real number is a 2-tuple of coprime natural numbers. A coprime is a pair of integers that can't be broken down anymore. For example, 4/8 or 4 and 8 are not coprime because a common factor of 4 divides the 2 integers down to 1/2 which is a pair of coprimeality.",math,Tak5035,False,/r/math/comments/kkvtzy/is_this_a_good_explanation_of_what_a_real_number/

Possible to learn measure theory for a non-mathematician?,1608932941,"Hello.

I study medicine and have an interest in neuroscience research using bioinformatic approaches, proteomics, etc.

I've always found it frustrating through my whole education in statistics that we are just taught calculations and such. I would like to understand \_why\_ we can use what we are using.

As far as I've read searching on google, it is measure theory that's behind the construction of the mathematics behind statistics?

My question is, how possible is it for someone with no other mathematic background than senior high school mathematics to learn measure theory and how long would it take doing it as a 'hobby' beside my studies? I'm used to reading scientific literature in biochemistry, molecular biology, and such but my math knowledge is introductory calculus, etc from senior high school/beginning of college (our education system is a bit different in Europe than the States).

And as far as I can read on the internet, the way to measure theory is to learn analysis first?

Is there an efficient algorithm for determining the order in which matrix transformations were applied to create a final transformation matrix?,1608875171,"Word spaghetti in the title, I know, but I'm working on toy CS project and I'm struggling to figure out if there's a way to use math to avoid doing a lot of work.

Let's say I have a set S which contains X_1...X_k invertible matrices. Suppose I then make a matrix Q by right multiplying n randomly selected  (with replacement) matrices from S. Is there an efficient algorithm, if I know S and Q, to determine X_1...X_n such that Q=X_1*X_2...*X_n ? 

I know I could find Q in k^n multiplications by essentially just brute forcing all possible combinations. This is unfortunately not really practical since I expect k to be over 10,000 and n to be possibly even larger. In my toy project, I can pick arbitrary values for X_i and so I'm wondering if there's some linear algebra feature I can exploit to invalidate some of these choices.

One thing I thought of was to use a heuristic. If I know that the coefficients of all elements in each X\_i are positive, if any of Q\_{test} = Q*X\_i' are negative, I know that X\_i' is not the correct inverse of the last operation (since Q is only ever positive) and so can throw that away. This takes a large chunk out of k^n since many of the combinations will be trivilliay invalid.

This, of course, is a nice improvement but it still leaves me with a ton of combinations to attempt which isn't great. Does anyone have any interesting techniques I could try?

Godel and Tarski's theorem in the style of Cantor.,1608847338,"I have often heard that the various “diagonal arguments” of Cantor, Russell, Godel, Tarski, Turing, Kleene, etc., are all variations on the same basic idea. ([Lawvere’s Theorem](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Lawvere%27s+fixed+point+theorem) makes this explicit.) But I could only see a vague similarity between these results. In particular, the standard proofs of Godel and Tarski’s theorems that I see in textbooks use the following fixed-point lemma:

* [F0] For any formula F(x), there is a sentence G such that G is true if and only if F(#G) is true.

The fixed-point lemma can be proven in just a couple of lines, but I often see it described as tricky, unintuitive, difficult to motivate, etc. And its similarity to Cantor’s original diagonal argument isn’t transparent (well, it wasn’t to me.) So I decided to sketch Godel’s and Tarski’s theorems in a way that makes their similarity to Cantor’s Theorem perfectly straightforward. I imagine this is old news to many of the readers here, but since it wasn’t obvious to me, maybe some readers will appreciate this. We’ll start with a version of Cantor’s theorem.

**CANTOR’S THEOREM**: There are uncountably many binary sequences.

Proof: Suppose for contradiction that there are only countably many binary sequences. Then we can enumerate them S*_0_*, S*_1_*, S*_2_*,… Call S*_n_* the **nth sequence.** To get a contradiction, we define a “diagonal sequence” D that disagrees with the nth entry of the nth sequence. That is, we define D so that:

* [C1] For each n: D(n) = 1 if and only if S*_n_*(n) =/= 1

Since our enumeration of sequences includes ALL the binary sequences, there must be some number d such that D = S*_d_*. So we can rewrite [C1] as:

* [C2] For each n: S*_d_*(n) = 1 if and only if S*_n_*(n) =/= 1

We get a contradiction when n = d:

* [C3] S*_d_*(d) = 1 if and only if S*_d_*(d) =/= 1

** PRELIMINARIES FOR TARSKI’S THEOREM **

Let a **predicate** be a formula in the language of arithmetic where ‘x’ is the only free variable. If P(x) is a predicate and k is a number, the sentence P(k) is called the **kth instance** of P(x).

Fix an enumeration P*_0_*(x), P*_1_*(x), P*_2_*(x), P*_3_*(x),… of all the predicates. Call P*_n_*(x) the **nth predicate.**

**TARSKI’S THEOREM**: The relation “the kth instance of the nth predicate is true” is not arithmetically definable. That is, there is no arithmetical formula TRU(x,y) satisfying the property:

* [T0] For all n and k: TRU(n,k) is true if and only if P*_n_*(k) is true.

Proof: The situation should look similar to Cantor’s Theorem. Instead of an enumeration of all the sequences, we have an enumeration of all the predicates. As in Cantor’s Theorem, we aim for a contradiction by defining a “diagonal predicate” D(x) that disagrees with the nth instance of the nth predicate. We can do this by letting D(x) be the predicate ~TRU(x,x). Then it’s easy to check that D(x) satisfies the property:

* [T1] For each n: D(n) is true if and only if P*_n_*(n) is not true.

Since our enumeration of predicates includes ALL the predicates, there must be some number d such that D(x) = P*_d_*(x). So we can rewrite [T1] as:

* [T2] For each n: P*_d_*(n) is true if and only if P*_n_*(n) is not true.

As in Cantor’s Theorem, we get a contradiction when n = d:

* [T3] P*_d_*(d) is true if and only if P*_d_*(d) is not true.

**GODEL’S THEOREM**: There is a sentence that is true if and only if it is not provable in PA.

Proof: Godel showed that the relation “the kth instance of the nth predicate is provable in PA” IS arithmetically definable. That is, Godel found a formula PROV(x,y) such that:

* [G0] For all n and k: PROV(n,k) is true if and only if P*_n_*(k) is provable in PA.

Now we follow the same exact pattern as Tarski’s Theorem. We let D(x) be the predicate ~PROV(x,x). Then D(x) satisfies the property:

* [G1] For all n: D(n) is true if and only if P*_n_*(n) is not provable in PA.

Since our enumeration of predicates includes ALL the predicates, there is some number d such that D(x) = P*_d_*(x). So we can rewrite [G1] as:

* [G2] For each n: P*_d_*(n) is true if and only if P*_n_*(n) is not provable in PA.

Now we observe that for n = d:

* [G3] P*_d_*(d) is true if and only if P*_d_*(d) is not provable in PA.

Long story short: diagonal arguments work when we have a collection of “first-order objects” (e.g., natural numbers) enumerating a collection of “second-order objects” (sets of numbers, sequences of numbers, predicates of numbers, etc.) So by keeping the enumeration of arithmetical *predicates* firmly in view, it’s easy to see how Tarski’s theorem is almost exactly like Cantor’s, and Godel’s is almost exactly like Tarski’s.

Planets guaranteed to align in a 2D plane?,1608722980,"I should preface this with saying I’m by no means a math expert; the highest I got to is number theory, but that was about 2 years ago so most of that is forgotten, let alone calculus or trigonometry. Also, sorry if this isn’t the right subreddit to post this, I wasn’t entirely sure if it called under what the rules allowed or not...

Anyways, with that being said, with the whole event of Jupiter and Saturn getting so close to each other, I started pondering; 

Given a 2D system of 3 or more bodies that orbit a single point, is it guaranteed that they will all align at some point? Assume that each body orbits at a different, yet constant speeds. 

So I think I managed to prove this, but I was hoping someone could verify this for me or not. 

First, restructure the problem, such that instead of circular orbits we instead talk sin waves, and see that “planets aligning” would be equivalent to sin waves intersecting, with y axis being a planets angle to some constant radius and x being time. We know that since sin waves are continuous functions, any 2 sin waves must intersect at some x value. For example, we can say sin wave S and sin wave T intersect when x=A, where A is some constant. If we want to bring in a 3rd sin wave, sin wave U, and find out where IT intersects with S and T, we can find what x value sin wave U intersects with S (x=B) and T (x=C). Then we just multiply A, B, and C to find the x value where all 3 sin waves intersect. And this can be extended to any number of sin waves without loss of generality.

Sorry if this was long winded. It’s been a while since I tried to write a proof, so sorry if it’s not the most elegant or I made some stupid assumptions. I just can’t get this problem out of my head and would really appreciate it if someone could help me put it to rest.",math,hoodie_lover,False,/r/math/comments/kirfmd/planets_guaranteed_to_align_in_a_2d_plane/

The steady arcs to infinity: a construction of the hyperreals without ultrafilters.,1608699765,"Let's (try and) canonically construct the hyperreals! No ultrafilters required.

I'll start with some motivation. We can construct the simplest number system that contains infinitudes by simply adding a single completely arbitrary infinite number to the reals and closing under elementary operations. The usual convention is to call this number ω. So  ω + 1 is a number, as is 1/ ω + ω\^2. We can't simplify these expressions any so we actually have something isomorphic to the set of rational functions, only we have substituted the constant ω into our variable x. So our representation of a potentially infinite number seems to just be a nicely behaved standard real function evaluated at a non-standard number.

This is an ordered field when ordered eventually-wise: 

Let f is eventually greater than g mean there exists an n s.t. for all x&gt;n, f(x)&gt;g(x)

This is all nice but what about bigger infinities like 2\^ω or even craziness involving the Ackermann function, can we extend to them? Yes! And if we keep going until we run out of 'nicely behaved' functions we will get the hyperreals.

All we need to do is define a very general notion of nice behavior so that the set of such functions is totally ordered eventually-wise.

So we need a set of functions s.t. any two of them will eventually stop intersecting one another.

Let's think in terms of 'wiggles'. In order for an f to intersect many times with some g which has only a few wiggles, then f must wiggle many times. There is an assumption here that wiggles are a sort of capacity to cause intersections that can be counted. This is almost certainly true for polynomials, given how simple they are.

&amp;#x200B;

So we begin by defining a ""wiggle"" count function W that maps real polynomials to naturals.

In order to make it 'count things', it turns out that we will want to somehow get subadditivity:

For any p &amp; q, W(p+q)&lt;=W(p)+W(q)

The idea is that a sum of two polynomials can potentially have some of the wiggles cancel out, but simply adding polynomials doesn't introduce any brand new wiggles.

We will also want each 'wiggle' of a polynomial to represent a capacity for the poly to bring one additional intersection to the table when being intersected with another poly.

This will follow from requiring W(p)&gt;=NumDistinctZeros(p)

&amp;#x200B;

Now we define W recursively over polynomial degree:

  W(any constant):=0    //a constant function doesn't wiggle at all

(Let A(p) be the set of polynomials of degree less than the degree of p)

  W(p):=MAX over a from A of NumDistinctZeros(p-a) - W(a)

&amp;#x200B;

By construction we immediately have subadditivity when the two polys are of different degree. However, it will have to be proven that it also holds when the degrees are the same. 

Define an arc of a polynomial as its restriction to an interval, including possibly infinite intervals.

Define the wiggle count of a polynomial arc p as the MAX over \*all\* polynomials a of NumDistinctZeros(p-a) - W(a)

Define a steady polynomial arc as a polynomial arc of wiggle count at most 1.

Define a steady arc as any function (a,b)-&gt;R which is a limit of steady polynomial arcs.

The hyperreals should then be able to be identified as the germs of those steady arcs which are defined on a neighborhood of infinity. Alternatively, they can be the maximal 'steady continuations' of steady arcs to infinity.

&amp;#x200B;

I am fairly certain it can be proven that the steady arcs to infinity:

(1): are closed under the field operations. (I never managed a proof for multiplication)

(2): are totally ordered eventually-wise. (Easier)

(3): can grow just as quickly as any continuous function. (Harder)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Wiggle count might be useful for polynomial approximation as a measure of simplicity to avoid overfitting and such. It seems possible to define a multidimensional version as well, but it hurt a bit to think about when I tried.

The steady arcs to infinity are actually just the standard part of certain hyperpolynomial arcs restricted to the reals. Segments of polynomials can be 'polynomially continued' and so steady arcs can be steadily continued and this continuation-type behavior is closely related to how mathematical induction manages to remain valid for the hyperfinite. It's also a way to see why analytic continuation exists.

Hopefully I got all of that close enough to correct. I have a bad habit of rarely writing anything down and I don't usually prove things so much as I cross-reference educated conjectures and fill in the biggest gaps of things that cohere well. So it's really all just conjecture. I'll put a few highlights about this wiggly business that I remember in a comment.

&amp;#x200B;

So assuming this all works, it allows us to define a couple interesting things already. However the real prize is constructing the hypernaturals and thus uniquely define ultrafilters and all that that would bring. Summation methods that always work, completions for all the things, uniform hyperreal probability for any set naturals, reals, etc. Any infinite set that is part of a sufficiently complicated structure should be able to be given a canonical hyperreal measure relative to that structure which refines cardinality.",math,Apeiry,False,/r/math/comments/kimmfp/the_steady_arcs_to_infinity_a_construction_of_the/

Let's Discuss this function and it's weird behavior!,1608656685,"Hello, I am not very educated in math, just your nerdy high-school boy who like math a lot. So anyways I was studying about the Binomial theorem and made this function (for fun) whilst solving a question similar to it.

The function in discussion is: y = (1 + 10^(-x))^(10\^x)  

When the function is put on a graphing calculator the results were as expected.link: [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b6paxaodh1](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/b6paxaodh1)

But then I saw the graph starts behaving weirdly around x=14 and completely collapses at x=16.

[Weird Behavior discussed above](https://preview.redd.it/425ingr2qr661.png?width=734&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d1159e98c5ef488484c739c6a2dbe29ac2b839d0)

 I thought about it more and possible explanation was that maybe the function could be read as 1^(1000...) because 10^(-16) is a very small and negligible quantity. But it completely destroys the binomial theorem explanation which I used as a basis when making this function.

&amp;#x200B;

Also for negative values of x the function gradually saturates to y=1.  
This is also interesting for me as it is self-evident that the terms in the Binomial Expansion will be negative, since 10^(-x) &lt; 1, yet I can't seem to get a hold of the fact why it is saturating at y=1.

I would like to point out the values for positive values of x came out to be ≈ 2.71, which is Euler's number 'e' , given by:

"Discussing Living Proof: The Compassion Is Life-Changing, by Hortensia Soto",1608656414,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

Proof by assumption,1608649903,"Just a quick off my chest: I took a job in my university grading homework assignments (which was a horrible mistake, this is possibly one of the most mind-numbing jobs I have ever had), and for some reason, I keep seeing these types of proofs and it drives me crazy:

Proof: the only option is \[algorithm A\] which solves \[X\] in O(2\^n).

&amp;#x200B;

that that is ""the only option"" IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO PROVE AND YOU JUST ASSUMED IT!!!

The worst is when the assumption that the claim is true is then followed by three pages of a convoluted word salad and over-notation explaining why the claim follows from the assumption that the claim is true.

Another thing that can make me mad is when a long convoluted and imprecise explanation of the claim is then followed by ""to be precise: &lt;succinct and perfect two-line proof of the claim&gt;""

Is all of professional (pure) maths so abstract and sophisticated?,1608604423,"Hello everyone, I'm a first year masters student in an Algebra program in the Netherlands. I've loved maths since I was about 6 and up to until recently my favourite branch of maths has been Number Theory. That changed this year as I tried to learn Algebraic Geometry. Aside from being hard as cold steel, I get absolutely no joy in studying it/doing problems/thinking about it, which is weird, since it's considered to be a field really close to NT (right?). I don't think I have the sophistication that is necessary to succeed in the field.

I'm doing other courses in my program, but while Algebraic Geometry is the biggest offender, many of my other courses are in a similar boat (Commutative Algebra, Algebraic Curves, Algebraic Number Theory). I'm just not finding most of what I learn charming at all. After seeing this I miss branches like combinatorics and how 'groovy' they are (you know what I mean?)

My questions are:

1) Do I really need to learn Algebraic Geometry to get into Number Theory? If so I probably have a misconception about what Number Theory really is.

2) Is there a place for 'groove' in modern maths? Is there some branch that the average IMO participant would like, for example? Or is it ALL an abstract wall that you just have to bash through? I kind of have this idea that there is active research in combinatorics but you need to be a top of the top level mathematician to get into that world.

3) Could something like cryptography be more welcoming to someone with this mindset? I'm taking a Cryptology course and I kind of like it, but I don't know what comes after it, if that makes sense.

Can a non-trivial continuous dynamic system be expressed without differential equations?,1608594374,"I'm really interested in continuous dynamic systems that produce complex behavior: reaction-diffusion systems, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation, etc.

So far, all of the continuous nonlinear systems I stumbled upon online have been described in terms of nonlinear PDEs. I'm an amateur mathematician with little training and I (unsurprisingly) find PDEs challenging to work with: while there are relatively simple numerical methods (I played with explicit time-stepping and finite-differences for spatial derivatives), they tend to come with a lot of caveats and complications like instability, oscillations, numerical artifacts. 

Its further complicated by the fact that I'm mostly interested in coming up with arbitrary equations, tweaking them and looking at how various starting conditions evolve under them.

I tried looking into more refined approaches within finite-difference methods (stencils designed to have less anisotropy, operator splitting, stabilization of explicit methods) and while my simulations had better results. While implicit methods look like a good option, the need for solving large nonlinear algebraic systems at every time step makes them impractical for me.

I also looked into finite element and finite volume methods, but they seem to be mostly focused on physical systems. They also involve calculus of variations and other topics that are a bit too advanced for me right now. 

I know that there's no ""black box"" algorithm that can numerically solve an arbitrary PDE without need for careful design and specialized approaches depending on the type of the problem.

So I was wondering if there's a way to construct an explicit time evolution rule that doesn't require the handling of differential equations? Something like a function, designed in such way that makes it easy to discretize without distorting its behavior too much.

I get that the dynamical systems designed that way probably won't have relevance in modeling real world, but since I'm just exploring these simulations out of curiosity, that isn't particularly important.

"Is it possible for an efficient algorithm to (provably) exist, yet finding one to be undecidable?",1608588707,"(For TL;DR, read the second and last paragraphs of this post.) This is a thought that came to me when I was thinking about possible resolutions of the P vs. NP problem. Most people believe that P≠NP,  or that if P=NP then polynomial time algorithms to NP-complete problems have huge constants or exponents. 

However, I haven't read discussion of the possibility that finding such an algorithm could be undecidable. More precisely, given a polynomial time algorithm solving an NP-complete problem, it's always the case that correctness or efficiency of the algorithm is undecidable. Note that this claim is independent of whether P=NP or P≠NP; we could still have proofs of P≠NP, or non-constructive proofs of P=NP.

So this is what I imagined. We have non-constructively proven that every polynomial time algorithm to, say, 3-SAT problem verifies whether an instance of the problem can be reduced to one of finitely many special cases, each of which is solvable in polynomial time, and that such an algorithm exists. This proves P=NP. Then we prove that finding the finite list of special cases the algorithm uses is undecidable, thus proving that finding an efficient algorithm to 3-SAT is undecidable. This fictional scenario is inspired by the result in graph theory, where any minor-closed collection of graphs exhibit a finite list of forbidden minors, which (once found) are ""efficient"" to check. 

And here is, in my opinion, the most interesting and possibly useful part of this idea. If we only want to prove undecidability of finding polynomial time algorithms to NP-complete problems, we could try to engineer an NP problem (not necessarily complete!) such that finding polynomial time algorithms to it is undecidable. To me it seems there is quite a lot of room for experimenting this strategy.

Redefining a set of transformations as a single linear transformation using tensor product?,1608514108,"I learned today that a multilinear map $A \\times A \\rightarrow B$ can be re-defined as a single linear map $A \\otimes  A \\rightarrow B$,

, where $\\otimes$ is the tensor product. 

I have a set of transformations in an iterative algorithm, and I would like to determine if they collectively count as a multilinear map, in order to ""reduce"" the multiple transformations to one linear map. Here are the set of transformations I want to represent as one transformation:

$\\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_d = \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d \\odot (W \\cdot \\left(\\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_{d-1} \\oslash (W\^{\\text{T}} \\cdot \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d)\\right) + \\left( (V \\cdot \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_{d+1}) \\oslash \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d\\right))$

This can be rewritten as a function $\\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_d = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d, \\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_{d-1}, \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_{d+1}, W, W\^{\\text{T}}, V)$.

This function involves three linear transformations, $W, W\^\\text{T}, V$. My goal is to determine whether I can use a ""tensor product trick"" to rewrite $\\mathbf{f}$ as a function of a single linear transformation, $U$. That is, I want to find $U$ such that:

&amp;#x200B;

$\\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_d = \\mathbf{f}(\\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d, \\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_{d-1}, \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_{d+1}, W, W\^{\\text{T}}, V) = \\mathbf{g}(\\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_d, \\mathbf{y}\^{t}\_{d-1}, \\mathbf{y}\^{t-1}\_{d+1}, U)$

Telling supervisors you don't want to take the course they recommend,1608508328,"So I'm currently in grad school doing my Msc at the moment, but at my school acceptance requires supervision upon entry.

Additional context, both my supervisors work in PDE and one of them is teaching the course I'm taking at the moment.

How do you know you are passionate about mathematics,1608495401,"Hello all,

I am graduating this coming spring with a bachelors in math and I am reading many of the forums about following math into grad school. The general consensus I get about getting a PhD is that you have to be **passionate** about math. The problem is, I am not sure if I am passionate or not. I am passionate about financial mathematics, programming, stats, and other general quant type concepts. I also LOVED my discrete mathematics course. In our bachelors, we don’t take Real Analysis, which I know is the basis of all higher level maths. I am planning on working full time in finance and doing a part-time online master to take Real Analysis and other things I missed out of the reward to say that I did it and hopefully understood the content. 

I guess this leads to my question: 
How do you say you are passionate about mathematics?

I mean, I enjoy the concepts but I don’t find particular joy in the raw calculations. I don’t enjoy spending over an hour trying to figure out how to solve an particular hard integral, but I do enjoy learning the concepts and methods used to calculate many of these things. The proofs themselves are fun and thinking about them philosophically is fun. I hear “math is not about the calculations, it is about the concepts.” But I fail to see that after completion of my bachelors degree. So much of it was sitting down and churning out solutions to problems. At some point, it MUST be about the calculations. 

This leaves me to the question of what does it mean to pursue a graduate degree in mathematics. Can I go in with the mindset of “I am going to learn keep these concepts until I am not longer enjoying them”? Can I just keep doing math without a plan and just follow it out of my own interest? It seems like many people have an end goal, but I am not sure whether I should truly have one.",math,2TiteforSpandex,False,/r/math/comments/kh1e60/how_do_you_know_you_are_passionate_about/

I also proved that if a\_n &gt; 0 and lim na\_n = l and l=/=0 then summation (a\_n) diverges. So I concluded that the sequence I need should also contain infinitely many zeroes.

I am still not able to find such a sequence with all these results. 

I would appreciate any help. Thanks.",math,ClassicMurderer,False,/r/math/comments/kgroq0/limsup_problem/

"Is math a ""language"" (exclusive) or a ""vocabulary""?",1608449293,"I was watching a physics lecturer talk about how there is no ""mystery"" in so-called wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, it's just a failure of our language to describe it, and so we need a new language: math.  And math describes QM very well and unambiguously.

I've heard and said variations of this statement many times, but this time it got me thinking.  Given any mathematical expression or equation or concept, I can express it in English.  It may take paragraphs to get it all out, I may have to first define a bunch of terms, I may have to use all kinds of qualifiers, it may make things very hard to follow and be so obtuse as to be useless, but in principle I can't think of a reason I couldn't put any mathematical expression into a normal verbal language like English, or French, or Mandarin.

So assuming I'm right, then how do we say ""math is a language""?  Isn't it really a vocabulary?  Or more to the point, isn't it more accurate to say that math *has* a language/vocabulary associated with it?  I mean, sets and topologies and mappings aren't language, they are structures and concepts that we *describe* with language.

How do *you* think about these things?",math,TakeOffYourMask,False,/r/math/comments/kgpx14/is_math_a_language_exclusive_or_a_vocabulary/
Can I become a college math professor only with a master's degree?,1608448719," I want to teach math in a college.

Can I become a college math professor only with a master's degree?

Homelessness and covid (math),1608446351,"In America, the average life expectancy of the homeless is 17.5 years shorter than their housed counterpart. We also are looking at 30-40+ MILLION evictions as a result of the economic lockdown. So multiply 30 million by 17.5 years and you get an estimated 525 MILLION years lost from reduced life expectancy, merely from factoring in this one variable (there are many others, crime, education, property prices, etc).. The average life expectancy of a housed adult in America is 78 years.. So divide 525 mil by 78 and you get 6,730,769 ENTIRE LIFETIMES (from birth to 78 years) lost.. Just from factoring in the LOW estimate of 30 million impending homeless, and their reduced life expectancy..

I was reminded today of how fun math is,1608438360,"TLDR: A curiosity over the cool looking integral of ln(x) introduced me to my first ever reduction formula.

Imo ln(x) has a very cool antiderivative. Today, out of nowhere, I just thought let's see what ln(x)\^2 comes out to; what was surprising (in a good way) was that the integral of ln(x) was within the answer. Glancing at it a couple of hours later, I noticed that actually the entire solution looks a lot like the integral of ln(x). I was then curious as to whether the integral of ln(x)\^3 would be similar, which turned out to be correct. Doing it for ln(x)\^n resulted in the pattern I was seeing of xln(x)\^n - n( integral ln(x)\^(n-1) ). This just seems so cool to me and is such an awesome pattern, especially since my Calculus II class never covered reduction formulas so I hadn't even heard of them until half an hour ago. Also, I'm a CS major, of course I like recursion.",math,XtremeBlaze777,False,/r/math/comments/kgnif5/i_was_reminded_today_of_how_fun_math_is/

Real valued functions with complex area,1608435979,"I've been thinking about this for a while and, likely due to my mathematical immaturity/illiteracy, I really can't come to understand what it intuitively means for a real valued function to have an integral that is complex.

Could anyone explain to me (a 1st year engineering student) in really simple terms why this is or maybe just refer me to a link that could explain it more in depth?

Need some help with the average of a long list of numbers,1608428358,"Hi, I'm Jim

I'm a competitive Rubik's Cube speedsolver. I have a session on an app with 12,161 solves. Every ""solve"" is a time in seconds ranging from 7.37 (my fastest time) to 18.93 (my slowest time). Just to be clear, a solve meaning how long it takes me to, well, solve a Rubik's Cube. The current displayed average of this session of 12,161 solves is 13.194. Every few times I do a solve in a time that is less than 13.194, the number appropriately goes down. However, since the total number of solves is so high, every SINGLE solve I do that is less than 13.194 does NOT move the average down since it's calculating the average of 12K+ times. For example, if I manually enter a time of a whopping 12 hours, the average still says at 13.194. I've been doing lots of solves because I want to get that session average to less than 13.00 seconds, so 12.99. Is there a way I can calculate that after x amount of solves UNDER 13.194, I can get to 12.99?

Basically, when I start a new session, so with 0 solves, the average of the entire session always changes. If I do poorly on a given day and get, say, twenty 15 seconds solves, the average would move/stay closer to 15 seconds. If I get a 10 second solve, that average would dip down since a new number that is significantly smaller than the others would be added. However in my case, I have 12,000+ solves, and the average doesn't get smaller as quickly as it would if it were a session with not a lot of solves.

So this average is heavily impacted by the total number of solves. I don't actually count this but maybe every two or three solves that are under my average result in the average getting smaller. Is there a way I can calculate that after x amount of solves, my average will be less than 13.00?

Much appreciated. I know nothing about anything and contrary to what people generalize about Rubik's Cube speedsolvers, I am trash at math.

Gemini Gemini
Leo : Gemini

So I jokingly said ""So a Gemini has no standards and would practically date anyone"".  She was offended and told me I was reading the chart wrong.

Fathers and sons problem (I guess?),1608413612,"Hey guys,

I once got asked the question: Two fathers and two sons go to the cinema but only 3 people buy a ticket. All get in, why? Solution: They are son, father and grandfather.

That riddle is quite fun but I came up with a smiliar one. The clue in my version is that the grand-father is also a father and the grand-son is also a son.

So for the 1st generation we get: father and son --&gt; 1 father and 1 son.

For the 2nd generation we get: son, father, and grandfather --&gt; 2 fathers, 2 sons, 1 grand-father, 1 grand-son thus 3 fathers and 3 sons.

What's wrong with this formulation of the math-tea argument?,1608397266,"Descriptions of finite length are countably infinite

Some finite length descriptions specify a single real number

Therefore the real numbers that have a finite length description are a subset of all finite length descriptions

Since there are uncountable reals, then some reals have no finite length description.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone may argue:

Suppose there was a way to enumerate these real numbers

Then, by a diagonal argument, there's a real number not in the enumeration

Therefore the enumeration cannot exist

&amp;#x200B;

I agree the enumeration cannot exist. However the conclusion of the math tea argument still holds, I believe:

In general, some of the finite length descriptions will not correspond to a real number.

For example, suppose for some enumeration the first description is this:

""This describes the real number that is constructed by a diagonal argument on this enumeration""

This is nonsensical.

Now, with a bit of analysis maybe we can form a new enumeration without this description.

However, due to Godel's incompleteness theorem, for any axioms we may use, there will be descriptions that correspond to a real number, but cannot be proved to correspond to a real number. Because of that, no matter what axioms we use, we'll never be able to define precisely the real numbers that are describe-able - for that reason we won't be able to enumerate them. In general, when we enumerate through the descriptions, we won't know what descriptions to include as the defineable real numbers.

In short, every define-able/describe-able real number is in the list of finite descriptions, it's just that we can't always tell which descriptions are real numbers, or not.

Therefore the math-tea argument holds, namely ""some reals have no finite length description""

Where are all the higher math websites?,1608395630,"Sorry if the question sounds silly, but I promise it's not.

I've always been into the *educational* side of mathematics, especially when it comes to higher math: the more advanced mathematics gets, the more abstract it becomes and the more help is needed to really grasp it. But if this is so, *where is all the educational content of this kind?* At this point, most people would probably point at 3blue1brown or Khan Academy. But... that's not exactly what I'm talking about.

* First off, don't get me wrong—3blue1brown's videos are beautiful, but they're often about one single thing: I'm talking about content that ***covers a whole area of math***, such as linear algebra, general topology, etc.
* Now, there *are* some series on that channel (like the linear algebra one); however, they're still videos: I'm talking of ***text-based content***, so that looking up specific bits of text is easier and it's possible to read everything at one's own pace without depending on the speed at which the video plays.
* I'm also excluding Khan Academy because I'm talking of ***free content*** here: nobody owns mathematical thorems and proofs from undergraduate/graduate level math (or else any two books about e.g. elementary complex analysis would be in violation of each other's copyright), so by the law of large numbers it shouldn't be unreasonable to assume that someone out there might want to make this knowledge free for all.

The thing that comes the closest to what I'm describing here is probably [this collection of Calculus III notes at lamar.edu](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/classes/calciii/calciii.aspx)—but I haven't been able to find anything that comes even close to this for other subjects.

What about abstract algebra? Or topology? Or measure theory? Or ODEs? There's absolutely nothing out there. All I can find are just the coolest bits—here's the [5/8 theorem](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2018/09/16/the-5-8-theorem/) from group theory, for example; or if you like calculus, here's how you can build some intuition about [Green's theorem](https://mathinsight.org/greens_theorem_idea); but where's the bigger picture?

A question about random shuffling of a list,1608321706,"TL;DR: I made a program that shuffles, it seems random, but it isn't truly.  This is because my total number of choices is not divisible by my total number of possible outcomes post shuffle. My math question is, why does the number of outcomes have to be evenly divisible by the number of choices for it to be random? 

I am not a math guy, but am working through some programming algorithms, one of which is to make an algorithm that randomly shuffles elements in a list. For you math people that don't know code, don't worry, this is not a coding question! This is a question about randomness. 

Lets say that we have a list  \[1,2,3\] as our example, and I want to shuffle it. 

My solution to the problem was to iterate through each position in the list, and swap it with another position, generated randomly, which could also be itself. So 1 could stay the same, be swapped with 2, or be swapped with three. Then 2 could be swapped with 1, or stay the same, or with three, and so on. 

I run the program, and it shuffles, and it seems all good! 

But looking up the truly random algorithms, and true randomness, it seems that I have not achieved true randomness with my algorithm. Although it *does* accomplish shuffling, it does not accomplish shuffling *randomly.* 

Per a blog post knocking down my solution:

 

&gt;There  are some approaches to shuffling a list which may appear to be random  but actually are not. An approach that may seem uniform at first glance  is to iterate through the list and swap each element with any random  element. \[ahem\] The problem is that in order to achieve a truly uniform  shuffle, we cannot just choose *any* random element from the list. We must exclude elements at indexes that have already been visited/shuffled.  
&gt;  
&gt;How  do we know that an approach is truly random? **The modulus resulting from  the possible combinations of choices divided by the number of outcomes  available should be 0.** If the possible choices are *not*  evenly divisible by the available outcomes, then each outcome does not  have an equal chance of occurring. 

The writer is doing the annoying thing of citing a mathematical rule, without explaining the reasoning behind the rule. But according to the rule: 

My total number of choices is 27 (3 for each position). The total number of outcomes, however, is 6. {123, 132, 231, 213, 312, 321}. 

27 / 6 = 4 with a remainder of three. Not evenly divisible. 

&amp;#x200B;

My math question is, *why* does the number of outcomes have to be evenly divisible by the number of choices?

Why is the math tea argument wrong?,1608320764,"The math tea argument says:

In this case we have a subset of real numbers.

That's not what this means.

This means specifying a *single* real number.

You could formulate the math-tea argument as ""subsets of reals"", though, if you prefer - there are only a countably infinite number of subsets real numbers we can specify.

Start symbol: any

Production rules:

    any -&gt; 1
    any -&gt; f(args)
    args -&gt; args,any
    args -&gt; any
    f -&gt; af
    f -&gt; a

First, let's show how G works. Let's say we want to derive: a(aa(1),a(1))

We start with any and do substitutions according to the production rules:

any

f(args)

f(args,any)

f(any,any)

f(f(args),any)

f(f(any),any)

f(f(1),any)

f(f(1),f(args))

f(f(1),f(any))

f(f(1),f(1))

a(f(1),f(1))

a(f(1),a(1))

a(af(1),a(1))

a(aa(1),a(1))

**I claim only a countable number of real numbers can be described, precisely those generated by G.**  For example, if we take ""a(x)"" to mean to mean ""the number after x"", then we can enumerate through natural numbers:

    1 = 1 
    a(1) = 2 
    a(a(1)) = 3
    ...

If we take ""aa(x)"" to additionally mean ""the number before x"" then we can enumerate through all integers:

    1 = 1 
    a(1) = 2 
    aa(1) = 0 
    a(a(1)) = 3 
    a(aa(1)) = 1 
    aa(a(1)) = 1 
    aa(aa(1)) = -1
    ...

If we take aaa(x,y) to mean ""divided by"" then we can enumerate through all rationals:

    -- first all denominator of 1
    aaa(aa(aa(1)),1) = -1
    aaa(aa(1),1) = 0
    aaa(1,1) = 1
    -- all denominator 2
    aaa(aa(aa(aa(1))),a(1)) = -1
    aaa(aa(aa(1)),a(1)) = -1/2
    aaa(aa(1),a(1)) = 0
    aaa(1,a(1)) = 1/2
    aaa(a(1),a(1)) = 1
    aaa(aa(aa(aa(aa(1)))),a(a(1))) = -1
    -- all denominator 3
    aaa(aa(aa(aa(1))),a(a(1))) = -2/3
    aaa(aa(aa(1),a(a(1))) = -1/3
    aaa(aa(1),a(a(1))) = 0
    aaa(1,a(a(1))) = 1/3
    aaa(a(1),a(a(1))) = 2/3
    aaa(a(a(1)),a(a(1))) = 1
    ...

To define the square root of 2, we can use a system of equations.

First, define:

    2 = a(1)
    0 = aa(1)
    greaterThan = aaa
    exp = aaaa
    equals = aaaaa
    and = aaaaaa
    x = aaaaaaa(1)

Our equations: x\^2 = 2 and x &gt; 0

Rewrite:

    and(equals(exp(x,2), 2), greaterThan(x,0))

Then substitute with our definitions:

    aaaaaa(aaaaa(aaaa(aaaaaaa(1),a(1)), a(1)), aaa(aaaaaaa(1),aa(1)))

Every real number can be described this way - but there's only countable finite number of expressions formed from G.

Trying to generate tessellating hexagon distance-field with a user-specified aspect ratio + gap.,1608258683,"I'm working on a new function for a program I'm writing that allows users to generate contours of a sort of honeycomb/hexagon pattern where they control the aspect ratio of the hexagons and a uniform gap between them. The problem I'm having is figuring out how to determine how to scale the calculated distance value that is zero at the center of each hexagon and one where neighboring hexagons meet.

This is an analytical distance function that translates a pixel coordinate into a normalized ""tile"" coordinate where the four corners of the tile are the locations of the centers of 4 neighboring  hexagons, with one hexagon centered in the tile. (See: https://imgur.com/4mr6iHF )

The sample coordinate is mirrored around until we have a coordinate in one quadrant of the tile, to simplify the maths. From there it simply checks two distance vectors, one for the horizontal gradient on the left/right sides of hexagons and one for the 60deg angled sides. ( See: https://imgur.com/KKaJTQt )

In order to create a gap the resulting distance value is scaled up. This requires a different scaling factor for the horizontal distance gradients than it does for the 60deg angled gradients to produce a ""gap"" between hexagons where the distance value exceeds 1.0, which is intended to remain as the edge of the hexagons themselves after the gap is applied.

The situation is that the user can control the aspect ratio of the hexagons via row/column parameters, along with their gap parameter. For a square tile (i.e. a grid of squares) the scaling factor is easy to calculate as distance values lie on the cardinal axes and so the aspect ratio of the tile can be figured in to produce a uniform gap between neighboring squares. For the hexagon it's just as easy for the horizontal gradients (the triangle sixths of the hexagons that forms their left/right edges). For the angled edges it's a whole other can of worms!

It was my intuition that I could simply take the vector from the center of a hexagon to its angled 60degree edge (0.5,0.866025...), scale that by the tile's dimensions (which is determined by the number of rows/cols and the output field's pixel dimensions) and then I can use that to calculate a scaling value for distances along that gradient to result in a &gt;1.0 gap between hexagons.

Here's some pseudocode:

    // scale up 0deg vec to include gap
    scale0 = tilesize.x / (tilesize.x - gap);

    // scale 60deg vector by tile's dimensions
    vec2 deg60 = tilesize.xy * vec2(0.5, sqrt(3));
    scale60 = length(deg60) * 0.5;
    scale60 = scale60 / (scale60 - gap);
    
    ...   
    
    dist_0deg = scale0 * dot(pixel.xy / tilesize.xy, vec2(1, 0));
    dist_60deg = gy * dot(pixel.xy / tilesize.xy, vec2(0.5, sqrt(3)));
    
    if(dist_0deg &gt; dist_60deg)
        return dist_0deg;
    else
        return dist_60deg;
    

So, I simply scale a 60deg vector by the tile's dimensions - incorporating the aspect ratio into the calculation of the ""radius"" of a hexagon on one of its 60deg gradients (the two top and two bottom sixth-sections of the hexagon) which I can then calculate a scaling factor that will upscale distance values along that vector so that each hexagon contributes half of the gap between itself and its neighbor. The math above doesn't work - it's still wrong, the gap produced varies between aspect ratios and different gap sizes. The gap is correct between hexagons that neighbor eachother horizontally - that math is fine but I can't for some reason figure out how to calculate a proper scaling factor to produce a gap between diagonally neighboring hexagons.

I figure it's a stretch that anybody will be able/willing to dive into this and spend some time thinking about it - or maybe someone already has an idea or suggestion that's useful so I opted to take the time to post this here :P

How to self-learn music theory,1608227522,"Hi!

I'm interested in learning about the math behind music theory in my spare time. I don't really know where to start.

I'm not really sure where to start. Every time I dive in to a wikipedia article about it, there are so many music terms that I don't know, I just end up clicking link after link to get to ""the beginning"", and then run out of time or motivation.

Does this usage of maps and solution set make sense?,1608223267,"I have a discussion that is composed of multiple responses.

Finding a metric approximating a semimetric,1608220867,"I was reading up on Distance Geometry and came across the notion of a semimetric, which is a metric lacking the triangle inequality assumption. On Wikipedia, it reads that ""semimetric spaces naturally arises from inaccurate measurements"".

To make this description more concrete, let ε &gt; 0, and suppose that the space S is endowed with both a metric d and a semimetric d' such that, for all x,y in S, |d(x,y) - d'(x,y)| &lt; ε. It follows then that for all x,y,z in S we get d'(x,y)+d'(y,z) &lt; d'(x,z) + 3ε, a sort of triangle inequality with controlled error.

Is the converse true? Namely, if (S,d') is a semimetric space such that there exists an ε &gt; 0 satisfying d'(x,y)+d'(y,z) &lt; d'(x,z) + ε for all x,y,z in S, then does there exist a metric d on S and some 𝛿 &gt; 0 such that |d(x,y) - d'(x,y)| &lt; 𝛿 for all x,y in S? Can we find a metric with smallest 𝛿?

Alternatively, instead of having a constant error ε, we could assume that the error on our measurement scales with the measurement itself, that is, |1-d/d'| &lt; ε (with 0 &lt; ε &lt; 1). In this case, we get that d'(x,y)+d'(y,z) &lt; d'(x,z)·[1+2ε/(1-ε)] for all x,y,z in S. So conversely, if (S,d') is a semimetric space with an ε &gt; 0 such that d'(x,y)+d'(y,z) &lt; d'(x,z)·(1+ε) for all x,y,z in S, does there exist a metric d on S and some 𝛿 &gt; 0 such that |1-d/d'| &lt; 𝛿? Can we find a metric with smallest 𝛿?

This isn't related to my work and I don't know how to approach it, but I think it's an interesting question and I'd like to see what others think of it. Of course, if S is finite, any metric will work, in which case the problem of optimising for smallest 𝛿 is the only interesting part.

What makes representation theory special?,1608218923,"My title is vague, but that’s the best way to summarize what I’m thinking.

I’m a new math grad student finishing up a course on representations of finite groups. This is my first taste of rep theory and I’m enthralled.

My first specific question: why are only certain categories studied in association with representations? The big ones seem to be groups, associative algebras, and Lie algebras. Was representation theory of, say, rings ever investigated? Why or why not? Besides the obvious answer that we get important results in the three categories that I listed. Was this known beforehand or were there failed attempts at further generalization?

Second, even restricted to finite groups, representations seem to have a lot of important properties. The most striking one to me is this notion of induced representation - that a representation on any subgroup extends uniquely to that of the whole group. And of course it has many desirable properties like Frobenius reciprocity. Does this induction functor generalize to other categories, perhaps with a more abstract characterization? In other words, are there other functors which have these nice properties that induction does? I imagine any reasonable answer would have to involve adjoint functors (given the Frobenius formula).",math,ColourfulFunctor,False,/r/math/comments/kezh25/what_makes_representation_theory_special/

"Recommendations for a ""Crash Course"" of Real Analysis",1608162867,"My senior analysis course is broken into two semesters, and i just finished my first semester. My foundations, however, are rough, and I'm worried about coming into the second half of the course rusty and having problems due to issues with the foundations. I have roughly 4 weeks of free time that id like to devote to crash course the material. Are there any recommendations for texts which may achieve this, preferably by building the topic from the ground up in a rigorous fashion?

Topics I touched on this semester (In order, skipping minor points) : 

\- Completeness Property of R

\- Sequences

\-Bolzano Weirstraus THM

\- Cauchy Sequences

\- Sequential chracterization of limits

\- Continuity

\- Uniform Continuity

\- Lipshitz Condition

\- Differentiability

\- Extrema

\- IVT

\- Integrability, Riemann Integral

\- Characteristic Functions

\- FTC 1 &amp; 2

\- Change of Variable

\- Uniform Convergence of Functions

\- Log, Exp, Cosine, Sine

\- Cauchy Criterion for uniform convergence of bounded functions

\- Series

\- Cauchy Criterion for uniform convergence of Series of functions

\- weirstrauss M-Test

\- Integral Test

I feel like im missing the ""big picture"" and connections between these topics. For one, I fail to completely understand the connection between the integral, the derivative, and sequences. I also fail to understand the connection between series and the integral. Another issue I have is failure to understand why uniform convergence is so much stronger than pointwise convergence, (same with uniform continuity vs continuity at a point). I read online about how analysis is about how ugly functions can really be in addition to seeing the connections between some things I mentioned, but after taking this first half of the course, i fail to ""see"" these.

I know about crypto.

Now with that out of the way:

Earlier today I was reading this thread in MO https://mathoverflow.net/questions/153740/why-we-need-to-study-representations-of-matrix-groups ( it has some nice answers, highly recommend it btw ) and it got me wondering about whether there are completely fleshed out highly non trivial examples of uses of relatively modern and abstract results.

My understanding of the development of math is that people went from [heating rods of metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) , [looking at the sky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_mechanics), [noticing interesting patterns in numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_reciprocity) , [or even solving problems probably related to land and economic calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhind_Mathematical_Papyrus) to an absurd volume of different subbranches of mathematics dealing with hyperspecific circumstances arising from trying to understand all these things further. We are really good at abstracting away very difficult problems and isolating different obstacles and then developing whole theories dediated to it, just to repeat the process when a new challenge shows up.

But then I think its rare to see written down instances where people look back into whatever the original problem was ( perhaps not the 'original' but one halfway of the abstracting process ) and see how much one can say about it, using all the sub-tree of mathematics that branched out of that problem.

So, for example one could say ok we know a lot of representation theory of groups now! We thus understand group theory a little bit better than we did before, but why did we care about groups? Well because we wanted to understand some symmetries of some objects, so can we now understand these symmetries better? But why did we care about the symmetries? Perhaps to understand better some equations, equations which corresponded with some [geometric problem we physically cared for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doubling_the_cube#History). 

Of course we dont need any hightech representation theory to solve some of these classic theorems, but maybe it illustrates my point. It seems to me that in fact it is these more famous solved problems like Fermat's LT that are instances of what Im curious about, but these are few and use a relatively small portion of the very vast knowledge of the mathematics we develop. 

So my question is: Do you know of any concrete, well understood applications of modern mathematics?

Lemma on random affine equations,1608067476,"Hi all,

I have a simple lemma on affine equations that I need for a paper, but it seems like the kind of thing that would be proved already and I'd rather just cite it.  Have you seen this before, and where can I cite it?

Lemma: Let Fq be a finite field with q elements.  Let M : Fq\^m -&gt; Fq\^n be a uniformly random matrix, and let t : Fq\^n be a uniformly random vector.  Then the affine equation Mx = t is soluble with probability &gt; 1 - q\^(m-n-1).

Proof sketch: It's not soluble iff the dual equation is soluble, i.e. if there exists w orthogonal to all columns of M, but such that &lt;w,t&gt; = 1.  The probability that such w exists is at most the expected number of such w. For nonzero w and uniformly random x, &lt;w,x&gt; is uniformly random in Fq, so it satisfies these constraints with probability q\^(-(m+1)).  There are q\^n - 1 nonzero vectors w, so the expected number of such w is (q\^n - 1) / q\^(m+1) &lt; q\^(n-m-1) as claimed.",math,bitwiseshiftleft,False,/r/math/comments/kduvk9/lemma_on_random_affine_equations/

Plotting implicit curves,1608066289,"Hello,

Short Question: What is an efficient algorithm to plot implicit 2D curves with good results?

Background:  
I recently started learning python. As a training project I wanted to write a program that does some 2D fluid dynamics computation and visualization, because thats a topic I have to learn for my university class right now and I find it quite interesting and thought it's just a nice topic to learn coding with python.

While doing it, I stumbled upon a problem that I thought was trivial, but turned out surprisingly difficult for me (I'm not a mathematician). It's plotting implicit curves (curves that are given as f(x,y) = 0 and you can't \[easily\] solve for x or y). It's trivial to plot a curve which is given as y=f(x), because you only have to calculate an y value for maybe 100-1000 values to get a nice graph. One very easy way to plot the curves would just be calculating f for any (x,y) and paint the pixel if the given equation is satisfied, but of course the complexity grows quadratically with the resolution and this way is just so inefficient. I did some research and the most useful thing I could find was an algorithm from Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit\_curve#Visualization\_of\_a\_%20implicit\_curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_curve#Visualization_of_a_%20implicit_curve)  


I implemented it (especially the raster algorithm) and it kind of works, but I found it quite difficult to find parameters (raster point distribution, break conditions, ..) that give nice results in a fairly small amount of time for an arbitrary curve. Another problem is, that in contrast to explicit functions, where you can just interpolate between the values with a straight line and get nice results for a low number of x values, this is way more difficult at least for the above desribed raster algorithm that I tried to use (and for the trace algorithm it can be difficult to find the starting points).

So my question is: How do professional computing systems or libraries, which often give nice results in almos no time, do this? I could hardly find any information regarding this. For my program, I could of course just use a library that does it for me but I was just interested how it works with a good efficiency and accurate results.

Returning to school - Complex and Intermediate Analysis together?,1608062308,"I have a dual BS of ME/MATH, however let me say I feel it was a ""cheap"" Math BS, since instead of going through the rigorous analysis courses for advanced math classes I could use my advanced ME classes as credit.

I want to go back to school to apply for a pure math graduate degree, but I know it would be in the fall and would like to take some classes to get myself back up to speed.

How can i calculate the minimum price based on a desired margin and fee structure?,1608061739,"

Cost $10

Desired Margin: %5

Fixed Fee: %15

10×100/(100−(15+5))=

12.5$

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

This week's essay starts on *page 90* and is titled

How to move a car in an Isometric scene?,1608039585,"📷

I  have this question. I am currently developing a project for college,  and I'm making an isometric scene (XX rotation at 45º, YY rotation at  45º and ZZ rotation at 30º) with a car on it to move. But I cant move  the car in the proper direction, since the plane is inclinated by those  rotations.

"""griddy graphs"" -- graphs with vertices on grid points and edges only between adjacent grid points?",1608029708,"I encountered the following type of graph in my work and I wonder if there exists any known theory about these graphs which I call ""griddy graphs"":

A griddy graph G can be laid out on a (square) grid, such that each vertex of G falls on a grid point, and each edge of G must be between two *adjacent* grid points. Example:

    1 --- 2           7 --- 8
    |     |           |     |
    3 --- 4 --- 5 --- 6 --- 9

Obviously, griddy graphs must be planar (but not all planar graphs are griddy; for example any graph with a vertex of degree greater than 4 cannot be griddy).

I am looking for any necessary and/or sufficient conditions for griddy graphs (in the same style as Kuratowski's and Wagner's theorems about not embedding K5 or K3,3 for planar graphs).

Convergence of a complex-valued Stochastic Differential Equation,1608026286,"When you solve a stochastic differential equation such as dX = aX dt + b dW numerically using a method such as the Euler-Mayurama or Milstein schemes, you get a weak convergence that is linear, which is calculated as |E\[ X\_analytic(T) - X\_numeric(T) \] | where E(.) is the ensemble average over N independent simulations of X and T is a fixed point in time.

Suppose now that dW, which is a standard Brownian motion step that is complex-valued, e.g.

dW = 1/sqrt(2)\*( dW\_1 + i\*dW\_2 )  where dW\_1 and dW\_2 are statistically independent and ""i"" is the imaginary unit.

How would you calculate the convergence in this case given that X(t) will also be a complex-valued process? My first though was that you would look at the modulus squared of X, namely as

|E\[ |X\_analytic(T)|\^2  - |X\_numeric(T)|\^2 \] |

but then it occurred to me that this looks a lot more like the error in X-squared (in the real-valued case), which is related to the 2nd order moments of X.

Would it be more appropriate to calculate the error in the real and imaginary parts of X separately?",math,James_Colberg,False,/r/math/comments/kdiz5y/convergence_of_a_complexvalued_stochastic/

Made a puzzle I can't solve myself (solvable though),1608021053,"Hi, sooo... I made my own puzzle game in Unity, it's hosted online here:[https://simmer.io/@Adee1499/cog-puzzle](https://simmer.io/@Adee1499/cog-puzzle)

There are 3 cogs with 9 teeth, on each tooth there's a different number. You can only rotate the first cog and the other two rotate depending on what number is on top (even or odd). I have a problem though, I don't know how to solve it haha Here is the logic:

You can only control cog A. If the number on top (arrow pointing) is an even number, cog B moves one place clockwise, but if the arrow on cog A is pointing to an odd number, cog B moves two places counterclockwise. If the arrow on cog B is then pointing to an even number, cog C moves three places clockwise, but if the arrow on cog B is pointing to an odd number, then cog C moves four places counterclockwise.

THE OBJECTIVE IS TO HAVE THE ARROWS POINTING AT 9 ON ALL THREE COGS

I can't figure out how to solve it logically ( I know, ironic) , I can solve it by trial and error randomly but how would you logically come up with a solution for this?

Recursively defining the operation of summation (details in the post),1607998043,"So, I'm working on the exercises in Hrabacek and Jech's book on set theory (for fun, this is not homework) and I came across the following problem:

For each finite sequence of natural numbers, define \Sum&lt;k(0),...,k(n)&gt; so that

\Sum&lt;&gt;=0 (namely, the empty sum)
\Sum&lt;k(0),...,k(n+1)&gt;=\Sum&lt;k(0),...,k(n)&gt;+k(n+1)

Up to this point the book has covered recursion and arithmetic of natural numbers so we may assume that the concept of ""sequence"" (following the book's notation written using the symbols ""&lt;"" and ""&gt;"") as well as the symbol ""+"" are well-defined.

The exercise is not entirely clear about this, but I imagine I'm expected to justify why the summation is well-defined. It is quite clear that the book expects me to use some version of the recursion theorem. 

My idea is to use the most basic form of the theorem and apply it to the following function: having fixed a sequence of lenght n (which we may identify with a function f from the set n into the set of natural numbers) consider g(x,n)=x+f(n-1) (up to this point it has been proved that for n≠0 we have a well-defined predecessor which we denote ""n-1"") and use the recursion theorem to uniquely define

•  \Sum&lt;&gt;=0 (this should be fine as an initial condition since the empty sequence &lt;&gt; is just the empty set, which is also ""0"" by definition. So we are essentially looking at ""\Sum 0"").

•  \Sum&lt;k(0),...,k(n+1)&gt;=g(\Sum&lt;k(0),...,k(n)&gt;,n)

Under this definition we get the behaviour we expect from the ""summation operator"".

However, even though this seems to be a correct application of the theorem, something about this argument doesn't seem quite right to me, particularly due to the fact that instead of covering all sequences at the same time I'm forced to first fix a sequence before I can apply the theorem. In principle, there doesn't seem to be anything wrong with it since the sequence is still arbitrary, but I would like to hear your thoughts and suggestions.",math,Notya_Bisnes,False,/r/math/comments/kdcd7s/recursively_defining_the_operation_of_summation/

x and y are both changing variables and so to get the position of x on a graph, we need to do take y variable, add two and multiply it by three to find x variable.

Terrence Tao recently proved Sendov's conjecture for sufficiently high degree polynomials,1607970105,"There has been some excitement among Sendov's compatriots in Bulgaria for the last few days so I was a bit surprised that nobody posted it here. Tao used techniques from probability and complex analysis, among other things, to prove another case of [Sendov's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sendov%27s_conjecture).

I'm not really familiar with the conjecture, but it got me thinking whether it (or rather its contraposition) is somehow applicable for polynomial root isolation similar to how [Sturm's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturm%27s_theorem) can be used. Or maybe the conjecture can be applied elsewhere? I found [this article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5167) containing some interesting related problems.

"What is the chance that an infinite series of random numbers will, at some point, repeat all previously generated numbers in that order?",1607931396,"Okay, so admittedly, I don't know how to phrase this question better.  


Let's start with 1. Following this, there is a 1/10 chance that the next random number will be 1 also, meaning that there is a 1/10 chance that it repeats. Regardless of what numbers are generated after that, ""all previous numbers in that order"", have already been generated, that number, 1, being a repeat of the originally generated 1.

But let's say it goes a different route and gives us 2. So now, it's a 1/100 chance that the next two random numbers are ""1, 2"".   
Remember, ""**1, 2**, 6, **1, 2**, 8..."" doesn't count. The repeated numbers must be identical to all previous randomly generated numbers in that order.  


So, for an infinite set of randomly generated numbers, what is the chance that it eventually has a repeat? Is it guaranteed to happen ""eventually""? And can it happen with the digits of irrational numbers?  


\[Note: For an example of an irrational number where the digits ""eventually"" repeat, 3140 + Pi would satisfy the requirements with ""3143.1415...""s ""3, 1, 4"" being repeated with another ""3, 1, 4..."", thereby satisfying the requirement\]",math,pandicornhistorian,False,/r/math/comments/kct6nz/what_is_the_chance_that_an_infinite_series_of/

How to Like Math?,1607891912,"So, for context, I'm a high school junior. In order to get the job I want, I'll need to go into some sect of engineering or chemistry in college, which means lots of math. However, I've only ever been average at math, and even then it was only because I had friends in the class. This year I've really been trying to put my head down and learn, going for an understanding-based approach rather than just copying my friends. But even now that I'm trying so much harder, my grades have barely improved. It also doesn't help that my teacher rarely teaches by the book, making any other math teacher much harder to understand after she's taught my class in her own way.

My question is: how do I like math? Every other subject I'm good in- I excel at reading/writing and history. But that's because whenever I'm in doubt, I can usually just apply logic to the question and get an answer. In my opinion, math defies logic; math is just a bunch of rules I need to memorize, there's no logic I can use to puzzle out the answer.

m + 1/n = p          

p - m = 1/n

Get back into math,1607880894,"So In 1994 I graduated with a BSc in Mathematics and Statistics. I then completed a one year MSc program in applied statistics.  Now, I am a health care professional, with no real need for complex mathematical principles.

I will review the notes in her text and I will relearn these mathematical ideas, so that I can help my daughter. And it's somewhat exciting and stimulating to learn these things again. I am fascinated by math and science. I have an urge to learn math and statistics again. But, why would I be doing that? For fun? Does that make sense?

Algebraic geometry and its plot to take over the (analytic) world,1607877279,"There's been a flurry of activity recently about using algebraic geometry and category theory to replace topology as the foundations for functional analysis. In particular, Peter Scholze and Dustin Clausen have developed a program of condensed mathematics to do this (and there was a post last week about formalizing one of the main results in Lean).

As someone who is not a functional analyst, but somewhat adjacent to it, I've been reading about this and wrote a blog post with some thoughts. In short, I'm excited to see what new ideas this has to offer but also skeptical that it can efficiently handle questions that are needed for PDE analysis, so I think it is probably better suited as a companion theory rather than a full replacement.

From the time I was a very young boy all that I have wanted was to be a physicist/mathematician. I tried in middle school to read ahead, and could never understand it. When I got to high school I tried desperately but just became increasingly frustrated. I got to college and I majored in Math. I studied and studied, but nothing ever clicked. Not the most basic calculus, not the algebra, not the analysis. Nothing. I got a 0 on the Putnam, I was lost in every class. I tried and it is still my only goal- to understand math. I don't care if I am great, I don't care if I ever get a PhD, I just want to understand it... and I feel as though I don't have the capacity.

I feel like my goal is completely unattainable t- the only thing I have ever wanted, I will never achieve. The pain is quite intolerable. I have to move on and am headed to law school, but I don't want to. Every second I spend not doing math I feel like I am wasting and every moment I am doing math, I feel terribly inadequate, angry, and confused.

Not sure what the point is, but I can't explain this to anyone.

I find this error mind-bogglingly stupid. Students are required to know logarithms as a prerequisite to this course, so you can't seriously be telling me that students believed that we use ""In"" for natural log through their entire logs unit in high school.

Unit circles and Infinity.,1607735824,"I was doing this for fun to see what I would find. I'm a self-taught amateur ""mathematician"" and I just do things like this for fun in my spare time. I wanted to share this. If my thoughts here are flawed, please correct me. If anyone here has references that are related to what you see here, please let me know down in the comments below. Let have fun!

What I wanted to do is describe infinity as a location in a coordinate system. I wanted to treat infinity as a polar location like you could with zero. I wanted to see where the locations of zero and infinity would be depended on what equation you use as a reference. In this snapshot, I use x=0. 

In the picture, imagine you are an observer located at ( -1,0 ). You are facing the positive integers of x perpendicular to the y-axis. Now, imagine that there is a transparent line that is simply x = 0 (The black line). Light passes through the line and hits your eyes. As the light hits your eyes, you locate where that light passes through the unit circle. For example, you look exactly perpendicular towards the y-axis and you will see that 0 is located at (1,0) on the unit circle. With 1, the location in the unit circle is (0,1). You do this with all integers on x=0. 

[Math thang](https://preview.redd.it/sqs7avwmcn461.png?width=1881&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a9c18cb06e76bc9f3721ee6ff9533a7d33d2426)

Here is 0 through 7 (some are approximate values):

0: (1,0)

1: (0,1)

2: (-0.6,0.8)

3: (-0.8,0.6)

4: (-0.882352941176..., 0.470588235295...)

5: (-0.923076923077..., 0.384615384616...)

6: (-0.945945945... , 0.324324324... )

7: (-0.96,0.28)

The reason I'm not typing more values is that I couldn't notice any more patterns and I pretty sure there are more. I just don't have the competence to figure this out in detail at the moment. I'm sure you have noticed the symmetry with numbers 0 through 3. On 4, you will see a pattern of ...8823529... in both the x and y coordinates (maybe just coincidence). With number 5, I can't see anything in particular. Number 6 is very interesting to me. Both x and y have a repetend number.  Number 7 is a precise decimal number. As for the negative integers, It's going to be the same, but with the y sign flipped.

The goal here is to locate the coordinates of infinity as you approach infinity on the unit circle for x = 0. It's obviously going to be (-1,0) where the observer is located: e\^(i\*pi). But, now I have more questions. There is obviously a pattern here and want to know how it is the way it is I guess? Is there a way to explain this?

I guess what I am doing is projecting all the integers on the y-axis on the surface of a circle. In this perspective, there are no positive or negative infinities just like there are no positive or negative zeros. Negative infinity is just infinity, but you're approaching infinity in the negative direction. If you want all integers on the x-axis, you can make the unit circle into a 3d unit circle. 

Has there been anyone that's done something related to this? Anyone that is from the past? I'm pretty sure someone has thought about projecting an entire coordinate system on the surface of a sphere. Because of my lack of college education, I don't even know if this is useful.

Effect of fees on compound growth,1607720966,"Hi, I'm trying to work out the effect of fees on compound growth in investments. I've found a couple of online calculators but I haven't found an actual formula. 

I'm doing monthly contributions with annualised interest.  Which I've built a calculator for. But accounting for fees I'm not so sure about.

r = annual return

n =  compounding periods per year 

p =  number of payment periods per year 

rate = rate per payment period

m = monthly payment

&amp;#x200B;

rate = ((1+r/n)\^(n/p))-1

$ = P\*(1+rate)\^(p \* t)+ m \*( ((1+rate)\^(p \* t)- 1)/rate )

&amp;#x200B;

**Fees**

Say fees are 1% a year of total investment.  I'm tabulating this year by year. I could deduct that 1% each year, but it wouldn't be correct, as we'd be starting the next compound period but the gross investment, not what's left after fees. 

Perhaps

fee = 1%

$ =     P\*(1+rate) (100-1/100)\* (100 - )\^(p \* t)+     m \*( ((1+rate)(100-1/100)\^(p \* t)- 1)/rate )

The locus of points formed by the vertex of a rolling parabola is weird,1607574705,"[https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/tdsyr6nq](https://www.geogebra.org/calculator/tdsyr6nq)

I was trying to come up with a physics problem for a youtube video where you try to determine how tall a solid parabola shape can be before it's vertex is no longer a stable point and it tips over. 

Then I got to thinking, as the parabola got taller and taller, as it ""rolls"" in one direction, what does its motion in the x-direction look like? So I made this geogebra plot. And was quite surprised by the results.

When you open it up, slide the blue point left and right to tip the parabola over. This point is where the parabola contacts the rolling surface. Forgive my inefficient method of constructing this little toy. I'm not a geogebra pro-user. But I'll do my best to describe how I did it....

I wanted the control point to be the point of contact between the rolling parabola and the x-axis. So this required knowing the (x,y) coordinate along x\^2 where the arc-length from the vertex is equal to the x-coordinate of the control point. The arclength formula for x\^2 is hard coded into the algebra window. Once I knew the correct point, all I had to do is rotate and translate x\^2, the contact point on x\^2 plus its vertex to the control point, plot a locus, and see what appears.

The vertex of the rolling parabola stays close to the y-axis for a VERY long time. My prediction was that it would have been more like a cycloid formed by a rolling circle, but I was way off. I wish I knew how to optimize this because I'm not able to get the locus to go very far. Here's the same plot but zoomed out on the [y-axis only](https://i.imgur.com/grjKJyR.png).

I know this has something to do with the involute because the parabola is rolling on a ""frictionless"" surface, so the x-coordinate of the control point is equal to the length along the parabola that has been rolled, but I don't know how to proceed from here to really figure it out.

What I really want to know is... Does the vertex continue moving away from the y-axis forever? Or does it asymptote somewhere?

"A little prime generating constant I found (and some more about these constants, and sequence generating constants)",1607555113,"The following algorithm will generate every prime number in order(in case of confusion, while this constant exists and is tangible - it is impossible to calculate new primes with  it because said primes are needed to calculate its digits):

Imagine a set of infinite constants which follow the rule k_(n+1)=ceil(1/(p_n*k_n-1))*k_n, where p_n is the nth prime number. 

With that, the sequence p_(n+1)=ceil(1/(p_n*k_n-1)) will hold, essentially allowing you to calculate the next prime number from some constant and the current prime.

Now this only works if you pick  your constant specifically. In this case our constant k_1 is equal to 1/2+1/6+1/30+1/210...=1/2+1/2*3+1/2*3*5+1/2*3*5*7.

You will also need to know p_1=2 of course.

The interesting thing about this algorithm, is that it can be used to generate any sequence of numbers wherein their product grows by more than a factor of 10 each term in the limiting case. (Primes of course follow this property as any prime above 10 will incrase the product by a factor greater than 10). Sequences where this is not the case may work for a few terms but may eventually fail. Like many prime  generating sequences this is base specific, if you start with a lower base, the algorithm will actually work better, as the factor needed to 'encode' the sequence is lower. (In binary, the product must only increase by a factor of 2 every time). In higher bases all sequences can be encoded still if they eventually have that bases factor, it may just be that you need more 'starting terms' until the algorthm starts to work. There is more than likely a better bound for this factor than the base itself, probably something something ln that always pops up with this kinda stuff.

The way the algorithm works is like this (in the case of primes) given your k_1 = 1/2+1/2*3+1/2*3*5+1/2*3*5*7. You multiply k_1 by the first prime(p_1=2) and get p_1*k_1=1+1/3+1/3*5_1/3*5*7... taking the one from this you are left with the  number p_1*k_1-1=1/3+1/3*5_1/3*5*7. This is where the factor comes in. Everything after the first term becomes quickly negligible so we can say p_1*k_1-1 = 1/3+e for some small e. so 1/p_1*k_1-1 is going to be approximately 3. This will actually be slightly smaller than 3 because  of e, so we ceil it. We can now repeat this for every term to generate our sequence again.

Using this algorithm, you can use the same system to generate any sequence S_n:

given k_1 = 1/s_1+1/s_1s_2+1/s_1s_2s_3

k_(n+1) = k_(n+1)=ceil(1/(p_n*k_n-1))*k_n

Even though you must know the sequence to generate it, its still really cool to me that all you need is a constant - and that exact constant is already there in the real line, somewhere, encoding the entire sequence of primes, or squares, or multiples of pi, or anything.

So if you consider any S \in N, (with S_k representing the kth element in S from smallest to largest). K = {for all S  \in N, the sum from i = 1 to |S| of (the product from j = 1 to i of (1/S_j))}. This set of real numbers actually encodes every set (finite and infinite) of positivie alwyas increasing integer sequences.

Some questions I have: are there more algorithms like this? Are there any prime generating constants which are base independent? Are there any algorithms like this for sequences of integers/real/complex numbers? Are there any general sequence generating algorithms like this which are fully base independent? Does the set K have any cool properties?

Why is operator algebra considered a branch of analysis?,1607552419,"I think most people tend to think of operator algebras as a subfield of analysis. However to an outsider like myself, it seems like the field is most interested in investigating certain algebraic structures which happen to arise from an analytic context (like C* and Von Neumann algebras). Additionally, looking at some recent papers posted on the OA section of the arxiv, it seems like the techniques used are highly algebraic and even categorical. For example I saw plenty of commutative diagrams and exact sequences, but not too many estimates and inequalities. Why then is operator algebra considered a branch of analysis and not algebra, if the primary purpose is to investigate certain algebraic structures.

"Is complex analysis better than, or at least different to, real analysis?",1607547457,"Don't come for me, real analysis stans.

I've just come to the end of my first module of real analysis, and I'm underwhelmed. I was expecting to be enthused by it, but I've actually found it all really dry and uninspiring. It's neat, I suppose, but I wouldn't call it especially elegant or beautiful. And it's just not been fun.

""So what?"" you might ask. Undergrad doesn't like real analysis: many before me haven't and many after me won't. But what troubles me is the thought that me not liking real analysis means I won't like complex analysis. They are both analysis after all. I'm definitely going to do complex analysis when the opportunity arises: it's said to be a beautiful and important subject, and I don't want to miss out on it. But I'm worried that it's going to be something I put up with instead of something I enjoy, and that makes me a bit sad.

So am I right to be worried? Or is it simply too early to tell?

"I think I developed a proof for a^3 + b^3 = c^3 not being true for a, b, c being positive integers. Can you please check if I did something wrong?",1607543471,"I already know there are proofs for this, but I wanted to make one of my own. So:

a^(3) \+ b^(3) = c^(3)

If we complete the cube:

(a+b)^(3) = c^(3) \+ 3a^(2)b + 3ab^(2)   which is the same as c^(3) \+ 3ab(a+b)

Divide over (a+b):

(a+b)^(2) = c^(3) /(a+b) + 3ab

Resolve the square and take the 3ab to the other side:

a^(2) \- ab + b^(2) = c^(3) /(a+b)

Notice that the left-hand side is an integer, therefore c^(3) / (a+b) must be one too. This means they share a common factor. Because of it being a cube, we know c must also share a factor. This can be expressed as:

c = t(a+b)      Note that t does not have to be an integer, it can be rational. This is the part I am more afraid of being mistaken on.

c^(3) = t^(3)(a+b)^(3)

Because of this, we can say:

a^(3) \+ b^(3) = t^(3)(a^(3) \+ 3a^(2)b + 3ab^(2) \+ b^(3))

a^(3) \+ b^(3) \-a^(3)t^(3) \- 3a^(2)bt^(3) \- 3ab^(3)t^(3) \- b^(3)t^(3) = 0

a^(3)(1-t^(3)) = 3a^(2)bt^(3) \+ 3ab^(2)t^(3) \+b^(3)(t^(3) \- 1)

Now, if t &lt; 1 , we have that either a is negative (a contradiction for a being positive). If t &gt; 1, we have that the whole right expression, which should be positive, is negative; which is a contradiction for a and b being positive. If t = 1, however, we get that:

3a^(2)bt^(3) \+ 3ab^(2)t^(3) = 0

Which can only be explained if a or b = 0. Therefore, the only possible answers in the positive integers (if you can call 0 a positive integer) are:

a = 0

b = 0

a &amp; b = 0       This last one is not an answer given by my proof, but it is obvious enough.

This makes sense because any other value of t other than 1 would cause a contradiction.

Please tell me if I did anything wrong and, in that case, would I be far from a valid proof with this?

On Random Number Generation,1607478397,"Over the summer I figured out some pretty interesting mathematics with regards to random number generation that I'd like to share before I forget about it. Disclaimer: I have no idea what other work has been done regarding my questions.

The question I wanted to initially answer was this: Given some natural numbers n and m, and a ""black box"" procedure r which randomly and uniformly outputs one of n possibilities, when is it possible to create a procedure which randomly and uniformly outputs one of m possibilities. When this is possible, when can we provide an upper bound for how many times r will be invoked?

The question is motivated by problems with generating random numbers in the real world. One of the most used procedures is to use a pseudorandom number generator which generates one of n possibilities where n is very large (usually a large power of 2). Then, to generate one of m possibilities, we output n modulo m. However, if n is a large power of 2 and m is, say, 3, then this procedure doesn't produce a uniform distribution of outputs because otherwise the 3 possibilities for the outputs would be uniformly divided over the n inputs and 3 does not divide n.

Now suppose r is a procedure we are given which randomly and uniformly produces one of 4 outputs, say either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and we want to create a procedure which randomly produces one of 3 outputs. One option is the following: call r and return the output of r if it is less than 3, otherwise call r again and repeat the process. Unlike the previous solution, this produces one of 3 outputs, each with equal probability. The problem with this solution though is that given any integer n, we can't be sure that the procedure will end after calling r n times. With the previous solution, we only use the procedure we are given once.

So the question is essentially whether we can achieve the best of both solutions. And the answer is no! Before explaining why though, it's helpful to notice that we can think of such a procedure depending on r as rather a function which for input takes a string of outputs that r would have generated. Then instead of calling r during execution, we call r a bunch of times beforehand and pass a tuple of r's outputs into the function.

Now, suppose r was a procedure which randomly and uniformly produces one of n outputs (say 0 through n - 1), and we have a procedure s depending only on r which randomly and uniformly produces one of m outputs (say 0 through m - 1), and which calls r no more than N times. We create a new function f from {0,..., n - 1}^(N) to {0,..., m - 1}, where {0,..., n - 1}^(N) denotes the cross product of {0,..., n - 1} with itself N times. f is defined as follows: given an input (r\_0, r\_1,...), we begin executing s, except every time s would call r, we take the next coordinate of the input (r\_0, r\_1,...), and the output of s is the output of f. Since s only depends on r and s calls r at most N times, this definition of f is well-defined. Moreover, since r is random and since s generates uniform outputs, we must have that the outputs of f are ""split"" equally over the possible inputs of f. More precisely, we must have that m divides n^(N,) and that for any k in {0,..., n - 1}, |f^(-1)({k})| = n^(N)/m.

Since 3 divides no power of 2, this shows that what we wanted from the previous two examples was actually impossible! By the above, it is only possible when rad(m) divides n. However, there are more interesting questions to ask, and the next one I turned to was: given r, n, and m like above, what procedure depending only on r generates uniformly m outputs in on average the least number of calls to r?

Again, it's helpful to think of these algorithms as functions from the outputs of r to the possible m outputs, except this time, the input is an *infinite* string of outputs from r. It's also helpful to define these procedures in terms of trees. I have 2 examples below.

Suppose we have r like before, n = 2, and we want to create a procedure which uniformly outputs one of 3 possibilities. Have a look at this [tree](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q05mtUSflgwk-QQOAQlDMcO-GOhV5XFV/view?usp=sharing). Imagine copying the tree and pasting the root node where the leaf with an asterisk is and repeating forever. We can define a procedure using this infinite tree as follows:

1. Start at the root node
2. Call r. If r's output is 0, move to the left child node, otherwise move to the right child node
3. If the new node has a number inside of it, return that number. Otherwise, go to step 2. This procedure indeed uniformly generates one of 3 outputs, and it is optimal in the sense that it on average calls r the least number of times before producing an output. Like discussed above, however, it is not guaranteed to terminate after any fixed number of calls to r.

Suppose we have n = 2 and we want to create a procedure which uniformly outputs one of 5 possibilities. [Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m-DMWN5lNJYqjHwy_7cSMBhaGF89oj1m/view?usp=sharing) is a procedure which accomplishes this. Unlike the last example, this is again optimal, in the sense that there is no algorithm which accomplishes the same task in on average fewer calls to r! However, a procedure which naively uses 3 calls to r to generate one of 8 possibilities and ""re-rolls"" if the output is greater than 4 is far from optimal.

Notice that for each node in the tree, we can define that node's ""level"" to be how many calls to r it takes to reach that state. So in the last example, there are 5 output nodes with a level of 3 and 5 output nodes with a level of 4. To calculate the average number of calls to r the procedure requires, we can take the sum over all output nodes k of n^(-lvl(k))\*lvl(k), where lvl(k) is the level of k. This gives us an explicit way of comparing the performance of two procedures. To calculate the probability of the procedure outputting a particular value v, we can take the sum over all output nodes k with a value v of n^(-lvl(k)). If the procedure does generate outputs uniformly, then the value of this sum should be 1/m for each of the m possible outputs v. I will call any procedure for which this is true ""satisfactory"".

For the rest of the post, I will assume n = 2, ie r generates only two possible outputs. The procedures then are denoted with binary trees. The results however generalize nicely to any n.

Move 1: Then, if A is a satisfactory procedure with output nodes a and b which are on the same level, then the procedure A' which swaps a and b is also satisfactory! The easiest way to see this is to note that the formula for calculating the probability of A outputting a particular value only depends on the levels of the nodes, and not necessarily the positions of the nodes.

Move 2: If A is a satisfactory procedure and a is a node in A with children b and c both outputting the value v, then the procedure A' in which nodes b and c from A are discarded and a is turned into a node outputting v is also satisfactory! Moreover, the average number of calls A' makes to r is strictly less than the average number of calls A makes to r.

Suppose one now has a satisfactory procedure with two output nodes a and b with the same level and same output. One can use Move 1 to create a new satisfactory procedure in which a and b share the same parent. And since a and b have the same output, one can use Move 2 to create a satisfactory procedure which calls r on average a fewer number of times. Using this process, one can take any arbitrary satisfactory procedure and turn it into a satisfactory procedure which has at most one output node of any particular value on a particular level. It turns out these procedures are (almost... there's a small detail I'm leaving out) the optimal procedures with respect to the number of calls to r! How can we know this? Well, when taking these new procedures and calculating the probability that they output any particular value, we know we will obtain 1/m since the procedures are satisfactory. However, each output value appears at most once on each level, so looking at the formula I gave for calculating the probability of any particular output being given, it is calculating the expansion of 1/m in base 2! This expansion of 1/m in binary is unique up to infinite strings of 1s, so we know that the procedures we obtain using this process must be optimal. This even aligns with our result that rad(m) divides n, since this is exactly when 1/m has a terminating base n expansion!

And finally, given r generating uniformly n = 2 outputs (say 0 and 1), and any m, I present the *optimal* procedure for uniformly generating one of m outputs (0 through m - 1):

    1. let s = 1
    2. let t = 0
    3. if s &gt;= m then
        4. if t &lt; m then return t
        5. let s = s - m
        6. let t = t - s
    7. let s = s*2
    8. let t = t*2 + r()
    9. go to step 3",math,pirsquaresoareyou,False,/r/math/comments/k9i7xe/on_random_number_generation/

Is it possible to simulate a random walk with constant variance?,1607471193,"The Orsntein-Uhlenbeck process reaches a steady-state as time goes to infinity. In this long-time limit, its probability density function is a Gaussian with zero drift and constant variance.

I would like to simulate this type of random walk without having to wait a long time for the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to settle around its steady-state value. I have tried doing this by going from the Fokker-Planck equation to the equivalent Ito equation, by assuming a Gaussian distribution with zero mean and constant variance. In other words, the PDF is stationary and independent of time.

However, when you solve for the volatility term in the ito equation, namely sigma(X,t) as in:

dX = mu(X,t)dt + sigma(X,t)dW

I get the following expression:

dX = exp{ 1/2\*( x\^2/2s) - ln(x) ) } dW

Clearly this can't be right because ln(x) would yield non-finite, non-real values values if X&lt;=0 (which is inevitable since the random walk is centered at 0, so it will cross the zero-point at any time).

Study probability interpreted as reputation wagered.,1607461423,"I'd like to help clarify the debate about a controversial study by establishing that it is at least a substantial anomaly warranting attention regardless of whether we believe it.

Different statistical perspectives seem to be clouding communication so I will proceed primarily deductively and leave any inductive choices unresolved.

I'd like some quick peer review of my foundations here before posting to a medical subreddit and philosophers or mathematicians seem the best choices. I choose math. This isn't super math-y but it is important.

&amp;#x200B;

Back in August results came out from a study in Cordoba testing whether specifically fast-activating Vitamin D (Calcifediol) given early was therapeutic for covid. It was an unmatched imperfectly blinded pilot RCT.

Of the 50 treated,   1 progressed to ICU.

Of the 26 controls, 13 progressed to ICU.

&amp;#x200B;

If we were to assume only that the randomization and blinding were perfect then we could straightforwardly find the expected frequency of these results occuring purely by chance. It's equivalent to a question about shuffled cards: ""What's the frequency of the cards being in just the right order so that 13 or more of the people who ended up going to the ICU drew a card labeled 'control'"". 7.7 \* 10\^-7 ≈ one in a million. (Fisher's exact test)

There are roughly 20,000 RCTs each year, so let's say this unlucky result is a one every 50 years event.

Note that this frequency crucially does not depend on risk factors or various details of the study. 

Whether the unlucky event is due to an unfortunate randomization which favored assigning patients with a history of previous high blood pressure to the control group is irrelevant to how often you expect to see such an unlucky RCT come out.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's consider failures in randomization/blinding.

(1) It is difficult to see how a failure in blinding could have resulted in such a stark difference without intentional fraud. Even if better care was intentionally provided, a 1 in 50 ICU rate is unlikely.

(2) If it is this bad because the relatively simple randomization procedure was somehow improperly executed then this suggests gross incompetence or fraud. 

&amp;#x200B;

If we agree with (1) and (2) then we are left with a trilemma. Either the treatment helped or the results are due to professional malfeasance or a once-in-50-years-if-by-chance-alone event occurred. Sample size does not enter into the trilemma.

&amp;#x200B;

This is as far as deduction goes. Actually resolving the trilemma requires one to make the choice of which particular method to use to assign probabilities such that they all add up to 1.

My own preferred method is to alternate between angrily staring at the options and looking for corroborating data while grumbling until my cognitive dissonance disappears. A lot of people prefer Bayesian business instead. Whatever the method, incorporating outside evidence or subject matter knowledge is essential, as you all well know.

&amp;#x200B;

My larger philosophical point is that assuming only mild conditions we can come up with a p-value which expresses the degree to which we are forced to choose between experimental success and professional malfeasance. This is a reputational wager view of p-value. The lower the p-value, the more you are willing to put your career on the line. 

There's a bit more but it would just be distracting to post here.

"Discussing Living Proof: Just Don’t Bomb the GRE, by Amanda Ruiz",1607446814,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

"Computational Complexity , Turing Machines , prove function is or isn't time-constructible.",1607446653,"Hello there , I was studying for computational complexity the other day and I was practicing on Turing machines in general. At one point the questions in the slides had a more theoretical style. As I understand the meaning of the question as it just asks to prove that the following functions are time-constructible (or not) . On my own words I would say a function is time-constructible when 1. it is computable on a TM and 2. it is computed in time which itself calculates. So, 2\^n might be time-constructible if there is a TM calculating 2\^n (for any given n) and the calculation ends in at most 2\^n time (steps, seconds, some other time measure, etc.).

I don't really understand the process I have to follow in order to prove these assumption based on a Turing machine and following the note given.

(a) Show that the function 2 \^ n is time-constructible.

(b) Show that the function ⌊log n⌋ is not time-constructible.

(c) Show that the function n · ⌊log n⌋ is time-constructible.

NOTE: About (a) and (c) you do not need to give a complete description of the Turing machines that compute the functions 2n and n · ⌊log n⌋, except for a high-level description of their operation.

Why does normalization help with cross-correlation?

I have finished the task so far, according to the [documentation of MathWorks](https://de.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/xcorr2.html). Now I have to explain why the cross-correlation works better with a normalization. In the documentation, they have the matrix of the image and subtract the mean of the image of every point. I think this is neither normalization nor standardization, so I was wondering why are they doing that? And also why would a normalized matrix work better?

How to come to accept having at most middling understanding and its implications?,1607411357,"This is the question I have started to ponder during this semester, since in  all of the math classes I have taken I likely would have not been able  to finish a single assignment properly if I would not have had the  tremendous help one of my closest friends and a fellow student has given  to me. Let me expand on that.

I  am 22 yo and in my final year of an undergraduate student in computer  science. For my masters I have already decided to pursue mathematics,  pushing my understanding to the limits with a PhD is pretty much my end  goal. I am decently healthy in the sense that I am not suffering from  any xyz that would have lowered by capabilities during my studies. I  have also finished every single prerequisite course for the courses I am  taking now with straight A's (by miracle of God), so being unprepared  is not really applicable.

Having  said all of that, during the last semester, albeit this same theme has  been around since the start of my studies, I in all honesty could have  not finished a single assignment properly if it had not been for the  help I have received from one of my fellow students. By help, I mean that &gt;95% of the cases when I am finished with an assignment and we  are peer reviewing each other, I/he/we note that I have missed something  very critical regarding the problem. And critical in the sense that I  more or less have to start over/he has to explain in words of one  syllable what I need to do in order to finish the problem.

If  you wondering the nature of the problems, they are mostly applying the  learned theorems to given situation. Since I seem to understand the  material presented in the course, as I can explain it in plain words  (albeit I have had to spend incomprehensible amount of time to ingest  the information), I have a feeling that this speaks of something more  deeper. Namely that I seem to have an intrinsic problem with applying  the learned knowledge (Perhaps issues with intelligence?).

I  am not sure what to make of this. I can hardly blame my work ethic and  study habits since I have eliminated years ago anything that would  distract me from my studies. Therefore the best summary I can give to an  outside observer would be that in addition to already focusing most if  not all of his resources to given subjects, a student needs even more  resources and support just to stay in schedule. Moreover the courses we  are talking about are undergraduate level, for example one courses is  near equivalent to MIT's 18.445.

Given  that the amount of work needed to learn new in mathematics is strictly  increasing, I cannot shake the feeling despite how excellent my work  ethic is and how well I manage my time, how much I would like to learn  the fundamentals from all the fields I now, I am not cut for this  subject by whatever it is that makes one to learn fast, be it high IQ,  excellent aptitude etc. I mean to say that if the engine of my car is  now starting to slow down, it is reasonable to not expect it  miraculously gain speed in the future. On the other hand I know that if I  quit now before trying my best, at worst receiving the external  verification that I am not desirable (or an equivalent), I know that I  cannot live with myself.

To put  this originally-intended-to-be-short post bluntly, I can either try the  long march ahead and feel humiliated the whole way by having to drain  the mental energy in need for extra support from the people around me,  or I can try to put up an inner fascade where I accept that I was not  born to be as good as I want to be.",math,wabhabin,False,/r/math/comments/k8zo7c/how_to_come_to_accept_having_at_most_middling/

Trying to figure out what level of math for my degree.,1607381661,"I am an adult learning trying to re learn math. Long story short based on my school past and trouble learning i never learned past multiplication with some very very basic division. 

I attended university for computer science/info systems but the math in it had my head spin, i ended up having to take pre req math courses to qualify but given the time frame for the classes i never was able to learn it. 
That and spending in my case 3k for a math course that i dont have enough time to understand is a no sell point. 

I have been on Khan academy trying hard to relearn math and re apply for my degree but i  have zero clue what level math i need for it even though it tells me what math i will be taking, i just cant equate it in my head to the level i need to learn. 

Khan academy has a list to pick from to set up courses tailored to me but im unsure what point to stop at. I obviously not trying to be a nucellar scientist but i would like to at least be aware of the math ill be taking and sort of comfortable. 

If its not too much trouble could someone check my degree page and inform me which courses would be advised to select?

So I decided to do every exercise now onwards and decided that I had to redo Abstract Algebra and Analysis. Algebra is going great, I am able to prove things quite easily, and it's fun too. Analysis...I decided to do some point-set topology before going in as I heard topology gives you intuition for analysis. So I decided to work through the first two chapters of Gamelin and Greene. The first chapter on metric spaces was generally fine so far, although I had to look up the solutions for a few questions. Today I saw a confidence-crushing problem in the section on compactness which I was absolute unable to solve and understand. The proof seems very complicated and after reading it five times I understood the sequences being constructed and the convergence argument. The core inequality isn't difficult for me; most proofs revolve around using the triangle inequality to prove things. But I have absolutely no idea from where to start constructing, and have no idea what to choose for specifics(things like radius of a ball centered at x\_k). Can someone tell me how I can get better at this?

I have another question too. Is the second chapter on topological spaces easier? As in, are it's proofs more equality centered?

There's this ability that reduces the damage you take by 30% when you reach 30% of your max HP or lower. (So, if your max HP is 100, then once you reach 30 HP, all further damage will be reduced by 30%).

&amp;#x200B;

This applies actively as well, so if you have 40 HP, and take 20 damage, 10 of that damage will be applied as normal, and the next 10 (since you've reached 30% of your health) will be reduced by 30%, resulting in 7, which of course equals a total damage of 17 as opposed to 20.

&amp;#x200B;

What I don't understand, is that this apparently equates to an effective HP increase of 13%.

I've run into this concept in the past, but again, I can't seem to understand \*why\* it comes out to that. How does this reduction mechanic equate to a 13% increase in effective HP?

Is it normal to really love math but not enjoy programming?,1607272742,"People seem to run the two skills together a lot but despite really loving and having been pretty successful in higher math I’ve always found coding quite tedious/unfulfilling

People compare them on a high-level in terms of  the need for abstract-ness/logically breaking down a problem but in my personal experience coding so far the fun bit of mapping out the logic in your head in terms of pseudo-code is a pretty small % of the actual job, with the bulk being what (to me) feels like kind of having to wrangle your idea into an arbitrary language. I definitely don’t get the same kind of rush I get from grasping a concept in e.g abstract algebra when I understand the abstractions going on in some complex piece of software.

Coronavirus Math (Probability) has me a little skeptical (or worried!?),1607249557,"Hi. It appears that 14.7 million Americans have the Coronavirus. There are 328.2 million Americans total. This means that about 4.5% of Americans have the virus.  


My question is, why do I not know anybody who has had the virus? The probability of a random individual having the virus is 0.045. Suppose I have 300 facebook friends, assuming they are random and using binomial distribution, we find that the probability that none of my friends have the virus is   


1.00233172e-6, a very small number. This leaves me skeptical.

  
Now, obviously, my friend selection isn't random.

So I am still hopeful that the numbers being shared are accurate. It is reasonable that I, being 25 years old, am friends with people who are healthy enough to contract the virus and not know it. It is also reasonable to say that I, a person who tends to rid my life of dumb people, am friends with a demographic of people who practice safe habits to not catch this.

&amp;#x200B;

I am still annoyed that the number of people I know that have it is 0. It is tough to relate to something that is not directly affecting anyone I know.   


A side note: the assumption of randomness is better for going to a Grocery store since anyone can go there, right?   


Whenever I go to my large local grocery store, there are at least 100 people in there, maybe sometimes more than 300. So this probability calculation is probably even better to use here. The probability of nobody in the store having the virus is VERY small. However, we know that people are more likely to STAY HOME if they are sick. What about asymptomatic people, though? I feel like I statistically should have had the virus by now given that I go to the grocery store often.

Does this intuition about measurable sets make any sense?,1607204300,"I always try to find good ways to motivate a definition but the higher the mathematics is, the harder it gets. I am still a bit struggling to fully motivate „open“ and „closed“ in such a way that makes sense for any topological space, not just metric spaces.

The same I try to do for measurable sets and I want to share it, to see whether it is any useful at all. So here goes. Let A be a sigma algebra and the sets within will be called „measurable“. Let the intuition be that for any point x in A there is a procedure to show that x is really in A in some amount of time t &gt; 0, where t is constant throughout all x. In other words you have some way of finding out if something belongs to A if you are given a timeframe t and if that thing really is in A. Now the following observations are clear:

If A is measurable, then so is A^c. Just run the procedure and if it didn‘t show that x is in A after time t, then it is not in A.

If A_n are measurable for natural n, then the countable union is measurable. Run the first procedure in double the speed, the second in quadruple the speed and so on. In total the procedure will not exceed the time t and will definitely show that x is in the union, if it is in the union.

The empty set it measurable. Just say no.

The rest of the properties of sigma algebras follow.

Is this any good for intuition? What do you think of measurable sets? If anyone asks you what it means to be measurable, what do you say?",math,SupremeRDDT,False,/r/math/comments/k7gbwr/does_this_intuition_about_measurable_sets_make/

Book recommendations for undergraduate studies,1607194788,"Hello,

I was curious to hear some book recommendations that some of you may have that are not far beyond my comprehension level but still offer new ideas. 

A few of the classes I’ve taken are:

Calculus (up to multiple integrals)
Linear Algebra
Differential Equations

I still need to take:

Modern (abstract) algebra
All analysis courses

I would love a book that gives a good introduction to analysis or more interesting (like something that Khan Academy wouldn’t cover) concepts in the courses that I have taken. I would be more than happy to answer questions that may help you decide between a few books that you think would be applicable for me.

"A pretty counterintuitive result in an epidemic model, and what it means for your covid model",1607193889,"# The simplest possible model

You may recall that people around the first quarter of this year were posting a lot of articles about mathematical models of the spread of infectious disease, for some inscrutable reason. Suddenly, the concept of ""R0"" -- the average number of new infections stemming from each case at the early stages of an epidemic -- became a common talking point. Its value was, and is, the subject of news articles.

I'm sure most of you have already seen the simple model in which R0 is the only parameter. Each new infection cases R0 new infections at the beginning, so the epidemic grows exponentially at the beginning, eventually slowing down when it starts running out of victims. Flattening this exponential curve by reducing R0 became a political imperative.

----
# A slightly less naive model

I won't reiterate the details of the derivation of that model. Instead, let's move beyond this one-parameter model and look at a slightly more complicated model. It will have two parameters -- a probability p, and a probability distribution mu on the integers.


We assume that everyone meets the same people everyday, and for each person, the number of people they meet daily is distributed according to mu. The model of disease spread is just an SIR model: We divide people into Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered. On day zero, one random person gets infected from French kissing a pangolin, or cutting himself when skinning a mink.

Then, he infects each of his friends independently with probability p, before recovering and becoming immune. Each of his friends then proceeds to likewise infect each of their friends (except the original guy, who is immune) with probability p, before themselves recovering. This continues until there are no more infected people, and everyone has either recovered or never gotten the disease.

It is pretty easy to compute R0 in this model: It is specifically the expected number of people the *second* infected person infects -- he has some number D of friends, D-1 of whom are susceptible, so he infects a Binomial(D-1,p)-distributed number of people. D is in turn distributed according to mu, so R0 is the expected value of a mixed binomial distribution.

Now, I cheated a bit in the preceding paragraph: The model is actually underspecified. Picture the ""social network"" of our model, the graph with each person as a vertex and each friendship as an edge. We've specified the distribution of the degrees of each vertex -- the number of friends each person has -- but this doesn't uniquely determine the graph. There are many graphs with each given degree sequence. So, to fully specify our model, let's say that we first randomly choose the degree sequence, and then choose a graph with that degree sequence uniformly at random.

Having done this, our computation of R0 now makes sense, and if you carry it through, you'll find that R0 = p(E[D]+ Var[D]/E[D] - 1), where D is the random number of friends a person has.

Nice. So we've solved our model?

----
#How many people will get infected, and a surprising phenomenon

Well, no, there's still work to be done. Knowing R0 is cool, but what we really want to know is how many people will get sick. Let's call the proportion of people who get sick tau. This can be computed, asymptotically as the population goes to infinity, and the way to do it is pretty neat. However, it's also a bit advanced and not the point I want to make right now, so I'll just [link the paper doing it](https://www2.math.su.se/matstat/reports/seriea/2007/rep5/report.pdf).

Tau is of course a function of p and the distribution mu, so let's consider a hypothetical and compute some things using the formulae in the paper:

To begin with, before any social distancing, let's assume each person has a geometrically distributed number of friends, with a mean of 10 friends. People are social fellows.

If we were to recommend this population hunker down and isolate themselves, each person would choose their two closest friends to ""pod"" with, and otherwise meet only one other person ( a grocery store clerk, say). We can model this situation as well in our model -- we just replace our graph with people as vertices with one with pods as vertices and outside-of-pod connections as edges.

If we use our computation of R0, we will see that in the first case, R0=20p. In the second, we have a three-regular graph, for which we easily compute that R0=2p. So recommending people hunker down into their pods decreases R0 by a whopping order of magnitude, no matter the value of p.

So it is obviously a great idea to get people in their pods, right? We reduce R0 by so much!

Well, we don't just want a low R0, we also want the amount of people infected to be low. So let's plot this as a function of p, to see how much our recommendation reduces tau for various values of p:

[Plot](https://i.imgur.com/Dqg5ns7.gif)

Now, this is a pretty shocking result, right? Despite reducing R0 by an order of magnitude, if the disease spreads easily enough, we've actually *increased* the amount of people who get infected in the end by *decreasing* the amount of social contact! While for low enough p, we (less surprisingly) don't just reduce the final number of infections, we stop the disease in its tracks.

# Explaining the surprise

What is going on here? What does this mean? Am I saying that lockdowns are stupid and we should all be going out licking door-handles instead?

No, of course not. We started this journey with the observation that the one-parameter model was too simple, made too many simplifying assumptions, so we made ourselves a somewhat more complicated model, and got these weird results.

The first lesson to be drawn is that our second model is also incredibly unrealistic. Not just in the obvious way, that infection probability is not constant and people meet different people on different days, but also in a more subtle way, that you probably won't have picked up on unless you've thought about random graphs before.

Recall the observation that our model was underspecified, that we needed to pick not just a distribution of number of friends but an entire random graph? That wasn't just a technical detail, it was really the crux of the issue. In real life, your friends probably often know each other -- you have a couple of groups of people you hang out with, and everyone in that group knows each other, more or less. In our model, when we chose uniformly among all graphs with the right number of friends for each individual, we got something very different: We expect to see extremely few ""triangles"". In our model's reality, none of your friends know each other, and you don't know any of your friends' friends.

This isn't something you can fix by just choosing your random graph in a cleverer way and then proceeding as before, either. The fact that we see no triangles is crucial to the entire idea of the epidemic spreading exponentially in the beginning, and R0 being a relevant parameter. The method for computing the final proportion of infected relies on approximating the early stages of disease spread as a branching process. The picture should look like this near the start of the epidemic: 

When Sarah gets infected, she knows exactly one infected person -- the one who infected her. Her other friends are all not infected, and they all don't know anyone who has ever been infected, or anyone who knows anyone who has been infected, and so on. Their only connection to the disease is through Sarah. So Sarah infects on average R0 of them, and all of her friends she infects are now in the same position as Sarah was, so they again infect on average R0 people. So the disease spreads exponentially, with exponent R0.

If we see lots of triangles, this is no longer a possible approximation: Sarah's friends are likely to also know the person who infected Sarah, and the entire approximation breaks down. New, more difficult, methods are necessary to understand the situation, and the interpretation of R0 is very unclear.

# What this means for your model of covid

Unless you have a serious education in this stuff -- much more than I have -- your model probably is as flawed as the ones we've discussed here. Not just in the obvious ways, like our assumption that p is constant for all pairs of people, but also in more subtle ways that you might not even notice, like our choice of random graph model. Here, our model gave a clearly pretty absurd result, which clued us in to the fact that it is flawed in some way, but your model might not be so willing to reveal its true colours. (I of course chose the parameters to our model here precisely to get this seemingly paradoxical result.)

Question about convergence of Milstein scheme for SDEs,1607165756,"So it is said in the literature of stochastic differential equations (see for instance Oksendal, Kloeden) that the Milstein Scheme has order of convergence = 1 in both weak and strong convergence cases, whereas the Euler-Mayurama scheme has order of convergence = 1 in the weak case and = 0.5 in the strong case.

I am following the tutorial on: [https://hautahi.com/sde\_simulation](https://hautahi.com/sde_simulation) and so far this is how I am calculating the errors in my own simulation (I am using matlab to calculate the convergence of the Euler-Mayurama and Milstein methods for a Geometric Brownian Motion for which the analytic solution exists):

  
\- Weak convergence: take the absolute value of the difference in the ensemble averages between your analytic solution and your numerical solution, and then choose the maximum value as your ""weak error"" for that specific step-size dt.

\- Strong convergence: for each independent Brownian motion, take the absolute value of the difference between your analytic solution and your numerical solution, then average this over all your ensembles, and then choose the maximum value of the as your ""strong error"" for that specific step-size dt.

The main issue I am encountering is that no matter what step sizes I choose, or what number of independent random walks I use (e.g. MC = 10,000), the rate of strong convergence of both my Milstein and Euler schemes seems to always be the same at around 0.5, while the rate of weak convergence is always &lt; 1.0. This makes no sense because I thought the Milstein method is supposed to give strong convergence of order 1.0, but somehow I can't seem to replicate that myself.

Regardless of it being boundless, the stream of numbers is now different and much more than what we originated with? The best example I can think of this is time? (I know this is getting into science but I couldn't think of a better example to use) Since time is considered endless, wouldn't the time we added to be different than the origin point of the time we started with?

Let P denote the set of polynomials from R to R with real coefficients. Let D: P -&gt; P be the usual derivative operator, i.e. D(f)(x) := lim (h -&gt; 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h. Define the so called discrete derivative operator D’: P -&gt; P by D’(f)(x) := f(x + 1) - f(x).

It turns out that D and D’ are conjugate as linear operators - there exists some invertible linear map phi: P -&gt; P such that D = phi^-1 D’ phi. And there is in fact an explicit formula for phi - there’s a large chance I’m getting this not exactly right but it’s something like: define it on monomials by phi(x^(n)) = (x)(x-1)...(x-n+1) and then extend to the polynomials by linearity. 

This is kinda nuts - why should a discrete derivative be conjugate to the usual infinitesimal derivative? This may be just a coincidental feature of polynomials, but maybe there is a deeper explanation. I was also wondering to what extent this can be generalised. For example, does this hold for the class of analytic functions? I say analytic because they’re closely linked to polynomials, and it seems unlikely that this holds for general smooth functions.",math,Topology22,False,/r/math/comments/k6xhbs/weird_conjugation_between_discrete_and/

What is the maximum number of triangles possible as a result from clipping a 3d trinalge to a 3d cube?,1607127302,"\[@mods THIS IS NO HOMEWORK!!! THIS IS MY OWN PERSONAL INTEREST IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS!!! \]

&amp;#x200B;

What do i want to do?

I want to cut pieces off a triangle to fit it into a viewing frustum, without it overlapping, but without violating the ""only triangles"" rule.

When clipping against a plane (each side of a cube, or each side of a square), each triangle could split up into two individual triangles, but not more.

See:

https://preview.redd.it/t7mpt69of9361.png?width=536&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ec60b70bae75cb1f19f8e9f88099d56e40a77bd2

It DOES NOT have to split!

See:

https://preview.redd.it/n24ipxa6g9361.png?width=534&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=14b4917472d785cc5cbd4c23a55e0de0464ca0e9

I came up with this formula for the highest possible number of resulting sub-triangles:

`2^p`   // whereas p is the number of planes to clip against...

But something feels wrong about this...

&amp;#x200B;

Here are two deliberately bad cases, requiring clipping on EACH plane:

Clipping a 2d triangle to a 2d square: (Result: 7 triangles). But 2\^4 would be 16

Clipping a 3d triangle to a 3d cube: (Result: 10 triangles). But 2\^6 would be 64

What is the name for this rule?,1607124295,"I am working on different scenarios for calculating object collision and I am taking into account its position, velocity and acceleration. To keep it simple, in 1D I was trying to find the combinations of acceleration and velocity going towards and away for each object. I came up with a diagram (can't post it here for some reason but it looks like this &gt;&gt;--&gt;&gt;, &lt;&gt;--&gt;&gt;, &gt;&lt;--&gt;&gt;, and so on) where you can see that once you reach the mirror image of the first permutation the set is complete. Its analogous to binary where 1111 == 0000; so there are 15 unique members with the 2 velocities and 2 accelerations. 

In this case there is a left to right mirror where if you reflect those arrows in that direction you do not gain an additional member of the set. It seems like there could be a generalization of this where there are more ways of 'mirroring' members such that the number of valid permutations are much lower.

So the problem is as follows:

We have this hexagonal field which from the center goes 5 hexagons in each direction. We can place an additional 3 hexagons to the sides wherever we like. Now we have to put as many as the shape on the right in this field. The shape cannot be rotated and the central hexagon (in gray) may not be used as a part of the shape. What is the maximal ammount of shapes we can fit in the field? 

Here is my solution:

What I get is a total of 21. But there are 9 hexagons left, which makes me believe that this is not the best solution. I've tried some different variation of the 3 bonus hexagons, but it always seems to disrupt this pattern.

Problems i faced with the proof by contradiction,1607014524,"Need help with the proof by contradiction

So there is a series of lectures called “geometrical anatomy of theoretical physics” by fredric schuller. I started with the first lecture, which talks about logical axioms, and he starts by explaining this. I cant understand how by proving “if not p then not q” is equal to “if p then q”. His definition of a proposition (like those p and q) is : a variable that can take the values true or false, but nothing in between. 

So how can we prove that by proving “if not p then not q” is equal to “if p then q”? Take this example :-

Proposition 1 : object A exists
Proposition 2 : object A emits red light

We can prove, and it would be logically true that if not proposition 1, then not proposition 2, but this wont be the same as, if proposition 1, then proposition 2. Any help would be really appreciated.",math,Sufficient-Mango-841,False,/r/math/comments/k610ha/problems_i_faced_with_the_proof_by_contradiction/

I’m almost done with undergrad.  I currently have a 4.0 so my issue isn’t that I can’t understand math.  My problem is that there is 0 context or motivation for anything that I’m doing and the whole college experience seems designed to be demotivating and discouraging.  

I mean that.  For me personally I can’t imagine a worse possible learning environment especially now that we are all remote at my school. 

I want to know, for those of you who survived the gauntlet of college, is it just me?  Does school actually suck at teaching math?   Did you barely survive school but are currently loving your career in math?  I’m looking for some hint that my incompatibility with school doesn’t represent an incompatibility with math.  I have a feeling I’m not the only one.  Especially my classmates who their asses off but aren’t getting as lucky with grades as me.

"I studied inequalities at high school after differentation, limits and trig/log equations. Is this bad?",1606964350,"Hi! At high school I studied inequalities very late, my teacher explained them after differentation, limits, and equations. In fact, when I solved logarithm equations I used to write the inequality of the argument, for example ""x^2 - 4 &gt; 0"", without solving it. At the end of high school I noticed that I had some gaps: I never did irrational and trig inequalities and I didn't know that the multiplication of a negative number flips the sign, because we used the ""test point method"" where I never need to multiply for -1. I filled these gaps by doing few exercises, like 4/5 for each type of inequality. In spite of this I got a 100% grade in Calculus (in my country, Italy, the 100% is 30/30), but I can't stand that I studied these things in a very disordered way, without doing a lot of exercises about inequalities.

"My last little project was well received so here is another of mine: A continuation of the domain of logic variables {0, 1} to C.",1606944751,"I do this via probability (don't click off!) and polynomials. Now instead of explaining where the definitions come from I'll define them and show what cool properties they have.

A and B = A*B

A or B = A+B-A*B

A xor B = A or B - A and B

not A = 1-A

A nand B = not A and B

With these definitions you get the following properties. Firstly, it provides a map between logical statements and polynomials. However this is about all it does. In order to make this definition useful we will have to do one more thing. Say our logical statement, with these definitions maps L(A, B, C) to A^2C+2A-B+3B^3 (I have made this up). We can define a 'reduced' polynomial, which just 'reduces' all powers greater than one to a power of one. This reduced polynomial is how we will map logical statements to polynomials.

I will use the following terminology. A logical expression is to be defined as an expression combining the functions defined above in some way to produce some output {0, 1} when inputs {0, 1} are given for each input. E.g. L(a, b, c) = (a or (a and (b or c))) xor b. And a logical system as a set of these expressions which you can think of as a set of logic gates with some amount of inputs and some amount of outputs. Putting a subscript in either of these is the number of inputs and superscript the number of outputs. So the set of all logical expressions L_n=L^1_n is a subset of the set of logical systems with m outputs L^m_n.

Defining things like this gets you the following properties:

* There is a map between the set of all logical expressions (L_n for all n) and all degree one polynomials of n variables. Not only this, but the map between L_n and the polynomials of n variables is a bijection.

* The caveat to the previous point is that we are saying two logical systems are considered equivalent if they produce the same outputs for the same inputs. (for example a and b = (a and a) and (b and b))

* When the inputs of some L is in the range [0,1] the rules of probability are followed exactly. i.e. imagining the inputs to be probabilities of said input being 0 or 1(where 0.9 is 95% of the input being 1) will produce the probability of the output of that system to be 0 or 1.

*Creating logic gates this way and running simple programs through them (for example a binary adder) produces pretty interesting results for non integer inputs.


In cases of independent inputs (I.e. your system will never simplify to something like A and A). The unreduced polynomials can also be used. The unreduced polynomials are very interesting as well and come with their own properties

* The biggest being that you can 'invert' them. The inversion is in the form of infinite solutions to an equation but one can write for any system L an inversion L^-1 (which will have infinitely many solutions). 

* One can also find a 'eigen input' of any set of outputs logical system system by choosing the inversions of the unreduced polynomials such that it gives the output with every input being the same number. This is only possible over C. (Not R).

I am now experimenting with the logical 'gates' themselves in two ways: 1. with group theory and 2. with a bit of functional analysis and extending the domain of iteration of the gates themselves, such as finding the formula for a nth iteration of each gate and seeing what half an application of an and gate would be. (Thinking of a half iteration in the sense, that iterating a half iteration twice is the same as applying the and gate to two variables). I have only done this for some of the gates. (And I don't think there is any closed formula for the others). Interesting the inversions of the gates mentioned above are equivalent to the -1 iterations of the gates.

They have many more properties - I have a 15 page set of notes all about them which I will share soon.

New math term(s),1606939585,"I am currently in Algebra II and doing quadratics. Today while working on some homework I noticed a few consistent rules that we were never taught (I may post them later), and one of them is if c is negative, but b is positive then one of the non variable values will be negative and the other positive. Ok so what does this have to do with a new math term. Well, that got me thinking that there are certain numbers whose factors, or just groups of numbers (say in a data set) that have both negative and positive numbers. In certain cases of those sets, the values are able to swap being negative and positive with the opposite kind of numbers. As long as they SWAP consistently (if you have 2-4,4 in a set, if you take the positive from four, you can't give the negative to 2), you can keep the outcome of the data set the same. Hence, antallagable integers: numbers in a set of numbers who can swap negative and positive values with other numbers and still present the same outcome.

An interesting anomaly,1606930515," 

Q. Find all the non negative non zero triplets who sum is 100

ie x+y+z=100; x,y,z&gt;0 Answer is 485

My attempt

There is a very interesting corelation I realized, I am not sure how it works tho

I magine a cube with length 100 in a 3D co-ordinate system, as all the numbers should be non zero lets assume the cube starts from (1,1,1) not (0,0,0)

now for all triplets x+y+z=100, all the points below the plane x+y+z=100 are included and as this plane divides the cube in exactly half, we can calculate total number of points in cube and then half it.

total nos of points in cube = 99\*99\*99=9070299

half of 9070299 = 9070299/2=485149.5

Now this this is where it gets interesting,

according to the answer, the nos of points should be 4851 but I calculated 485149.5, I know that my solution is flawed but even then how am I getting a close enough guessable answer?? somehow I could have marked the 4851 option in the mcqs but I need to know how is this happening, is it just a coincidence or some weird phenomenon??",math,kundudev,False,/r/math/comments/k5dwr2/an_interesting_anomaly/

"I have ""invented"" an operation! (Maybe)",1606925752,"Okay, here's my theory.

You know factorials, right? What about the opposite concept? Instead of multiplying by all positive integers less than it but greater than 0, what about dividing by all positive integers less than it but greater than 0? I'd say that the symbol should be a ?, as I consider a ? to be the ""opposite"" of an !. I call it the ""divisorial"".

For example, the pattern so far would be as follows:

1? = 1 = 1

2? = 1 / 2 = 1/2 = 0.5

3? = 1 / 2 / 3 = 1/6 = 0.16666666...

4? = 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 = 1/24 = 0.41666666...

5? = 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 = 1/120 = 0.00833333...

And so on.

So, if that can happen, what about a ""sumorial""/""additorial"" or ""differorial""/""subtrorial""? Or a ""exponorial"" or ""logorial""? What symbols would be used for them? I'd consider using the upside-down ! for the ""sumorial""/""additorial"", and an upside-down ? for the ""differorial""/""subtrorial"".

Divisorial: the quotient that results from dividing a positive integer *n* by all positive integers less than or equal to *n*.

Sumorial: the sum of all positive integers less than or equal to the starting number *n*.

Differorial: the difference of all positive integers less than or equal to the starting number *n*.

Exporial: the result of raising *n* to the power of *n*, then raising that result to the power of *n*\-1, then raising that result to the power of *n*\-2, and so on until *n* is raised to the power of 1.

Logorial: the result of taking the *n*\-1 logarithm of *n*, then taking the log base *n*\-2 of that result, and so on until the log base 2 is taken.

To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

John von Neumann's genius and flaws,1606813006,"Sorry in advance for this pointless rant.


I'm doing my master's thesis on von Neumann algebras, so yesterday I was reading about John von Neumann online. I was completely blown away by his many accomplishments (e.g. I didn't know he introduced the concept of amenable groups!) and then on Wikipedia I saw the section on the Manhattan Project.


Now I know that a lot of famous scientists from that period were involved in the Manhattan Project, so I wasn't too surprised. Moreover, being a pure mathematician, he probably wasn't really directly involved, or so I thought.


The following information is all from Wikipedia. von Neumann didn't just do some abstract calculations. He was the one who calculated that detonating the bomb above the ground would have a larger impact than on the ground. He was present at the tests and estimated the power of the blast (also coining the term kilotons). He was directly involved in choosing the targets for the nuclear attack. He oversaw calculations about the blast radius and death tolls, and determined that Kyoto would be the optimal target for maximum impact. When asked about his involvement after the war, he responded with ""sometimes someone confesses a sin in order to take credit for it"", insinuating he was even proud of his accomplishments. During the cold war, he was also credited for developing the strategy of mutually assured destruction.


Reading all of this, I felt lost. I had been idolizing this mathematician ever since I learned about him. He was slowly replacing Hilbert as my favourite mathematician. But then, right when I was at the pique of my admiration, I learned he actively worked on dropping bombs on innocent people, killing hundreds of thousands.


It would be like learning that Hilbert actively worked to optimize the Nazi genocide. Except that he didn't. One of my favourite stories about Hilbert, also on wikipedia, is that when asked by the Nazi minister of education, Rust, whether ""the Mathematical Institute really suffered so much because of the departure of the Jews"", Hilbert replied, ""Suffered? It doesn't exist any longer, does it!""


I guess there isn't really a point to this rant. Of course, I am still amazed by von Neumann's mathematical breakthroughs, but I don't think I will ever be able to look up to him like I did before.

Identifying angular change with camera reference point/vector change,1606811883,"[Please see a visualisation of the problem here] (https://i.stack.imgur.com/jvEdR.png)

**Note:**  
1. All measurements are taken/derived from 2D coordinates based on the video camera.  
2. Arm is a shorthand for angle between the hip to the armpit to the elbow. For all intents and purposes, arm can be substituted for some other angle in the context of this question.  

**Setup A**  
Suppose I have a person standing infront of a video camera and lifts up his arm such that it is 90 degrees.  
If he moves back a 100 steps, and maintains the same stance, that arm will still measure 90 degrees.  
The camera is not moving.  

**Setup B**  
Suppose the same person instead moves diagonally a 100 steps away from the original position, the camera tries its best to follow the movement of the person towards the destination.  
The angle of the arm will now measure 60 degrees relative to the camera.  

**Setup C**  
Suppose the same person instead moves rightward a 100 steps away from the original position, the camera tries its best to follow the movement of the person towards the destination.  
The angle of the arm will now measure 70 degrees relative to the camera.

Encoding shapes as integer polynomials,1606795505,"I have been experimenting with encoding shapes as integer polynomials with the following algorithm. take the number of n dimensional ""points"" or ""segment"". Where a 0D segement is a point, a 1D segment is aline or curve, a 2D segment is a 2D surface etc. count them, say you have q. and then add to your polynomial qx^r. Do this for all parts of the shape.

You can describe some pretty non conventional 'shapes' this way, and the shapes that map to the polynomial can be very different but also share interesting properties. In some cases there are also relations to the set of real numbers.

Some patterns:

a point times a point is a line..

a point times any shape is the shape

a line times a shape is a prism of the shape in the next dimension (e.g. a square times a line is a cuboid).

x^n represents an n dimensional infinite plane (x^n is analogous to R^n)

n*x^(n-1)+x^n represtents a plane with positive coordinates. (eg. 1+x is anagolous to R_+ and 2x+x^2 is anagolous to R^2+)

Multiplying these polynomials (can) give some surprisingly sensical results. 2 infinite lines (x) multiplied will give you a plane. however two finite lines(x+2) multiplied will give you a finite square.

A circle is 'equivelent' to a line of infinite length.

Next I am going to explore the exact relation between multiplying shapes and their results, explore if the zeros of these polynomials tell us any informaiton about the shapes, and see if it is possible to make sense of fractional/negative powers/coefficients - if so some shapes could have 'inverses'. Imagine a shape with -1 sides!",math,jdm1891,False,/r/math/comments/k4d8dn/encoding_shapes_as_integer_polynomials/

Is it feasible to publish as a first year undergraduate?,1606792589,"I'm a pretty advanced student, despite being a first year I have been allowed to do second/third year classes (complex analysis, vector calculus and partial differential equations. I am enjoying the more rigorous side of complex analysis. However I'm already familiar with vector calculus but I was told to pick two and revisiting vector calculus seems like it would be helpful, I haven't done it since I was 15 or so). But my favourite thing since starting university is that I have been allowed to do one on one lectures with a professor, going through some of my 'papers' (I put it in quotes because I, so far, have written them informally as I have no training in paper writing) and he has been teaching me category theory, and starting differential algebra because they both relate heavity to the research I started before coming here.

I'm too shy to ask if I can publish something for real, but it is a dream of mine. I want to get into research without a doubt - this is my passion. One of my 'papers' contained a new result on the arithmetic derivative (cool little thing check it out) which was seperately published by someone else a few months ago - I had mixed emotions. I was very happy something I derived and discovered was something worth publishing and I was sad that someone else did it before me! [This particular of my 'papers' was the one I found most promising to be publised and the most developed of my ideas']

Back to the point, a  dream of mine has always been to publish in my first year of university. Of course for the bragging rights but also as a proof to myself that I am capable. I doubt my abilities a lot. Having something published would be undeniable proof for me that I am capable, and it would be an achivement I will be proud of my entire life.

But is it possible? Can I go from a formulated idea (I know what I want to write about) to a proper paper in less than a year? I should ask my professor to help, but what should I ask? He has already given me many tips on how formal papers are written and pointed out my unusual style of writing. As a side question: I have one on one time with an enthusiastic professor for two hours a week and possibly more - how can I best make use of this time? (Currently we have been going through my papers and research while he asks questions but we are nearly through them all after 3 months!)

He even build the real numbers from the rationals using Dedekind Cuts. The book also discusses n-Euclidean Spaces and Vector Spaces.

The claim is that a hot dog and a sandwich are topologically equivalent. Take a Subway sandwich - one piece of bread cut down the middle, lots of meats and veggies inside. Remove all of the toppings except for one slice of meat, and it can still be called a sandwich. Now, that slice of meat can be continuously deformed into cylinder (hot dog) and the bread can be continuously deformed into a bun that sort of wraps around said hot dog. The same logic can apply in reverse to deform a hot dog into the single-slice Subway sandwich.

Because only continuous deformations were applied to transform the sandwich into a hot dog and vice versa, a sandwich and a hot dog are topologically equivalent.

Equation for convex polygonal region,1606770942,"   As the title says plugging in a point from inside the convex polygon will make the equation true and otherwise it’s false. It just sets one side of the equation equal to the sum of the absolute values of areas of the triangles made from the sides and test point using the shoelace formula and the right hand side equal to the area you get using the absolute value of the shoelace formula all the way around the polygon. If the point is inside the polygon the areas will be equal and the left hand side will be larger if the point is outside. 
There are faster ways to do this computationally with a program but the point is just that there can be such an equation. Every example I can think of of an equation for a region of the plane involves inequalities not equalities.

Edwards (mathematician and famous expositor of classical mathematics) has passed away on Nov.10 this month",1606743829,"Having read a bit of his excellent book on Galois theory, I was just googling to see what else he might've written that might interest me and I noticed that on the German version of his Wiki page it says that he has passed away little over 2 weeks ago. A little research seems to confirm this and as I have found no posts regarding this on /r/math (strangely, there was one post on /r/crypto), I thought I should bring it to the sub's attention.

To those who hear of him for the first time, Edwards was a famous expositor of the classical and constructive approach to mathematics, having written many books following this approach, including the aforementioned ""Galois Theory"" (that included a translation of Galois' original paper on the subject, iirc), a popular book on Fermat's Last Theorem, another about the zeta function (that also includes a translation of Riemann's seminal paper) and others. He was a strong proponent of reading original mathematical works, a point of view presented in his ""Read the Masters!"" article.

Does 'norm of gradient of f' or 'cosine of laplacian of f' make sense in context of PDEs?,1606739148,"I've been playing with PDEs, trying to find a continuous analogue of cellular automata. I used explicit finite-difference method with some PDEs I came up with, and got interesting results. 

I'm trying to explore the topic a bit more, but I got stuck trying to find any information on PDEs containing differential operators under nonlinear functions. I know that laplacian on a 2d grid is just sum of second derivatives, but the fact that generally it seems to be approximated by 'stencils' rather than just a sum of 2nd derivative approximations is confusing to me.

There also seems to be difference between a normal stencil and a variable coefficient one, but I couldn't find any clear explanation of the difference and the reasons for it either.

So my question is: how would one approach finding a finite-difference approximation of a PDE containing nonlinear functions of derivatives? Are there any somewhat accessible books/papers/articles giving examples of working with such approximations or any general theory applicable for them?

Diffusion Simulation (aka what I did this afternoon instead of studying),1606691170,"I saw 3Blue1Brown run a diffusion simulation in a video and wanted to give it a go. Here's my code written in R if you're interested. 

For this simulation, I consider sequential boxes containing some amount of mass. For each time step, each box keeps one-third of its mass, sends one-third to the box to its left, and sends the last third to the box to its right. 

Edge boxes simulate a wall, sending one-third of their mass to the neighboring box while keeping the other two-thirds. 

For the case written here, we have one full box in the center of the sequence. To try other setups, you just have to change the interior of the second non-commented line from `rep(0,15),1,rep(0,15)` to something else. 

My next step is to generalize further, allowing a different diffusion scheme than the one-third/one-third/one-third already written.

I'm sure there are more efficient ways to do this, but the simulations virtually reach equilibrium by 500 time steps which my computer can do instantly so I didn't see a reason to make it faster.

Question about Benford's Law,1606690561,"To begin, I honestly am not interested in math, more just thought experiment/philosophy type stuff in general, but I had watched this show called Connected on netflix about Benfords Law.

Basically, it just says that based on the idea the 1's occur in basically every data set more than 2, and 2 more than 3 etc.

So in the episode he gets very deep about how if you take the frequency of a data set and see how many 1's, 2's etc there are, it always follows Benfords 1-9 commonality thingy. 

He goes on with the deep talk to show that even Volcanologists found a Benford's Law pattern in the frequency of Volcanoes, and their SIZE of area in square km. 

My WHOLE little rant here is that, isn't this really not that deep?

Like with our number system, you go 1-9, before you then move to the 10's place which repeats 1-9 making 1 and 0 more common, and seeing as numbers have to change to a new decimal place to increase their frequency,
 doesn't that mean that the higher the value, the more closely it will follow Benfords Law?

and like for ex., in square km, you can convert to mm, and then you have a LOT of digits to scan how frequent the 1's, 2's etc become, making Benfords Law even more accurate, right?


I apologize if I sound like I have no clue what I am talking about, I just didn't find it very surprsing that 1's were more common than 2, and etc., but I also found it very cool how it could indeed determine the accuracy of data based on how frequent 1's, 2's etc. appear.

Eigen Grandito - Principal Components Analysis of the Taco Bell menu,1606687102,"Hey all - recently I took a deep dive into the SVD/PCA.  My goal was to understand the math with confidence, and then use it for something interesting.

Between my study and the project, I feel I truly understand, mathematically, what the SVD does and why it works.  Finally.  Feels good.

Anyway, my project was to calculate the Eigen Grandito, which is named after the Onion article, ""Taco Bell's Five Ingredients Combined In Totally New Way"", which, in more mathematical terms, asserts that Taco Bell's dishes are all linear combinations of the same ingredients.  

And so the Eigen Grandito ""recipe"" is just the first principle component of the matrix of Taco Bell dishes and their ingredients.  In theory, the Eign Grandito is the ""most Taco Bell"" of Taco Bell dishes.

Tentatively ‘choosing’ a research area to explore in undergrad,1606672136,"Hello! I’m an [over]excited high school senior interested in studying math. I am wondering if it is too premature to pick a general area to explore more in undergrad. I have some background in higher-level math and am vaguely interested in learning more geometric (or algebraic?) topology—but I have no perspective on any fields or math research in general.

I essentially have two questions:

1. Is it unproductive to be thinking about potential research areas at this point? I mean I think I just need to take more classes, but is research something I could realistically ask a professor about right away wherever I go for undergrad?

2. Are there active fields in geometric or algebraic topology that are reasonably accessible? To clarify, I have the impression that in areas like algebraic geometry for example are practically impossible to get into/get into a grad school for unless you have been studying it for a very long time and are incredibly talented.

For context about my math background, I have taken courses in 

Basic analysis (level of the first half of baby rudin)

Theory of ODEs (stuff like linearization, properties of attractors, existence and uniqueness)

Introductory topology (started from naive set theory ended with an introduction to cohomology and duality, but didn’t quite get into poincaré duality)

And I am currently taking knot theory and dynamical systems. Both of these classes are trying to introduce us to some research skills, but I have no real research experience.

The biggest holes in my background I can see are in linear algebra, algebra and analysis—which I only know some things from because they came up in other courses and I have done some self-studying.

Integral defined as the limit of a sum,1606651869,"Hey :)

I recently started learning about integrals (not in school or uni, I'm just watching some videos by 3b1b) because in school we started diving into calculus and I thought it was pretty fascinating. I'm an absolute beginner though, so please go easy on me.

Once I thought that i understood the very basics of the concept of the integral, I tried to come up with my own definition for it. I thought about the derivation of the integral (the one where you split the area below the graph into many small rectangles and then watch what happens as you make them smaller and smaller) and then tried to write it down as the limit of a sum like this:

https://preview.redd.it/rxr5kyn836261.png?width=564&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e65ac673acc436cd4a48e9c5f9826b086a6c7ce

n is the number of rectangles we divide the area into, so (b-a)/n should be the length of those rectangles. We then multiply (b-a)/n with i and add it to a (the starting point of the function) to get the x-value of the i-th rectangle and plug that into the function to get the height of that rectangle. By multiplicating those two values, you should get the area of the i-th rectangle. The sum then adds up all of the rectangles and the limit n-&gt;infinity tells us what that sum approaches as we divide the area into more and more rectangles.

My questions about this:

* Is this even a correct definition? (It works when I plug some example values into wolfram alpha, but that's obviously no mathematical proof)
* Has this been formulated like this anywhere before? (I couldn't find anything online, but I'm also not really sure what I should be searching for on Google)
* Has this any practical use or is this just nonsense?

"Why does ""unit arithmetic"" not work when derivatives are involved",1606650129,"by unit arithmetic mean something like. F(N)=m(kg)a(ms^(-2)) impels N=kgms^(-2)=(kg)*(ms^(-2))

I do pure maths so units are not something I come across often so I wanted to try something like this with velocity and acceleration, using derivatives. However:

dv/dt -&gt; d(m/s)/dt -&gt; s = kt so ds=kdt and assuming a second is our base unit of time we can say k = 1 and so dt=ds. Now differentiating we get d/dt(ms^(-1))=d/ds(ms^(-1))=-ms^(-2)

There is a negative factor and I can't get over it! Acceleration and velocity are both vector values. As first I thought maybe for units the absolute value must be always taken, but if so it must be justified somehow. I am naively treating the units like variables here. So I'm not all that sure

The only other way around it I can see would be if k was somehow negative and ds=-kdt but I don't see why that would be the case. it seems like a slight increase in number of seconds seconds directly implies a slight increase in time.

Pokemon and Mony Hall,1606630600,"I was watching a twitch streamer open a Pokemon box set.  Each set has 36 packs, with 12 packs containing a holographic card.  They had opened 33 packs and gotten 11 holo cards.  Meaning 1 of the last 3 packs had a holo card in it.  A viewer was given his choice of pack.  There were 3 different artworks for the packs.  A Brock, Misty, and Erika pack.  Which I will notate as B,M, and E.  They were going to open the viewers pack last, which ever he chose.  If the Holo was opened in either of the other 2 packs, they were just going to ship the customer the pack unopened.

The viewer chose pack B.  They then opened pack M, which did not contain the holo card.  The viewer then asked to switch to pack E.  They then opened pack B, which again didn't contain the Holo.  They then opened the viewer's pack E, which unclimatically didn't contain an Holo either, they had miscounted and had already opened 12.  Regardless, was it smart to swap packs?  Or did it not matter?  

I've been trying to work  it out, it doesn't seem like switching should have mattered, but then what is different in the Monty Hall problem?

How does the general case work for this proof about consecutive prime numbers?,1606620305,"I just came across this is my text and I like to understand everything I read. I completely understand the specific cases they present, but I am confused about the general case.  

Let x = (n+1)!+2. We will show that none of the numbers x, x + 1, x + 2, ..., x + (n − 1) is prime 

To see that x is not prime, note that

x = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 ··· (n + 1) + 2  
= 2 · (1 · 3 · 4 ··· (n + 1) + 1). 

Thus, x can be written as a product of two smaller positive integers, so x is not prime. Similarly, we have 

x + 1 = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 ··· (n + 1) + 3  
= 3 · (1 · 2 · 4 ··· (n + 1) + 1)

so x + 1 is also not prime. In general, consider any number x + i, where 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Then we have 

x + i = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 ··· (n + 1) + (i + 2)   
= (i + 2) · (1 · 2 · 3 ··· (i + 1) · (i + 3) ··· (n + 1) + 1) 

It is that last x + i case that I dont understand. I DO see why the (i+2) gets factored out, and then in the specific cases, whatever was (x + i) was factored out. But in the general case, (i +1)•(i+3) is added to the values being multiplied, and I am not sure why those are there. And I dont understand how they make it true. For example, if we look at the second specific example where i=1, then we see them factor the (i+2)=3 out, but nothing is added.

Easily finding the amount of zeros in high powers of ten,1606617883,"I noticed a while back that it’s very easy to find the amount of zeroes in high powers of ten. To do this you:

Take the prefix of the number, add 1 to the number it converts to, and multiply by 3. Add 1 if its 10 of that, and add 2 if it’s 100 of that.

Example: 1 octillion

Prefix is octo, which means 8. Add 1, 8+1=9, and then multiply by 3. 9x3=27, so an octillion has 27 zeroes. If it were 10 octillion, you would add 1 to get 28 zeroes. 

The explanation:

For every comma in a large number, there is 3 digits. So in powers of ten, every comma equates to 3 zeroes. I noticed that in powers of ten, the prefix to the numbers are sort of set back, meaning a billion (bi=2) has 3 commas, a trillion (tri=3) has 4, etc. 

So to fix this, you just convert the prefix and add one to get the amount of groups of zero (commas). And since each group is 3, you multiply by 3. And of course there can be 10 and 100, so you just add 1 or 2 extra if that’s the case.

The most useful part of all of this is that you can work backwards. In this number:

10,000,000,000,000,000

You could count the commas, add 1, and your number will correspond to that prefix. This number has 5 commas, 5+1=6, so this number is sexdecillion (sex being the prefix for 6). You can also see it has one more zero before the last comma, so this number is 10 sexdecillion.

Reading this out may make it sound like it’s difficult and tedious, but it only takes seconds, and is much shorter than counting the zeroes and then listing out the powers of ten.

This may be a bit weirdly written, so ask questions in the comments. This could also be very well known and obvious, but I didn’t know, so may as well write here anyway.",math,MagicMeatbal1,False,/r/math/comments/k31gil/easily_finding_the_amount_of_zeros_in_high_powers/

2. Would it be expected for a high school math teacher to be comfortable solving problems from beginner-level and intermediate-level math competitions (e.g. MATHCOUNTS, AMC, AIME)?
3. To what extent of ""higher math"" topics would you expect them to know? For instance, would you expect them to know what a group is or for them to have exposure to the formal definition of a limit?

On Papers on Primes in Bounded Intervals,1606435064,"Hey,

I recently came across a pair of papers, one pertaining to the primes in the interval [2n, 3n], and the other to primes in [3n, 4n]. These papers are clearly solving [kn,(k+1)n] for cases k = 2, 3 without the prime number theorem, extending Bertrand's postulate. Is there anything stopping us from applying the same techniques used in these papers to higher k-values, or would this simply be a useless result until it could be applied to the general case.

Incompleteness theorems: formalising the notion of a system 'describing Turing Machines'?,1606412620,"Hi, I'm familiar with Gödel's original, tour-de-force proof of the 1st incompleteness theorem (whereby a formal system 'capable of enough arithmetic' cannot be both complete &amp; consistent). In his proof the concept of 'enough arithmetic' is relatively clear and can be boiled down to [Robinson arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_arithmetic) (in some form). The theorem can be attacked from a computability angle as well, which on an intuitive level, feels natural. I came across a [popular blog post](https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=710) that proves the 1st theorem purely from a computability (specifically, Turing machines) perspective. It's a nice read, and the notion of 'enough arithmetic' has been replaced by:

&gt;a formal system which is powerful enough to talk about Turing machines

I am trying to reconcile both conditions. I suppose when they say 'talking about Turing machines', we might essentially be asking for  'a system that can perform operations on say, the natural numbers, that simulate Turing machines'? One can encode machines and instructions as natural numbers of course and indeed modify/interpret them with some (basic) amount of arithmetic. To anyone more familiar with this, is that roughly what is being implied here? It wasn't quite clear how else to translate their statement into something concrete that becomes 'obviously equivalent' to the requirements Gödel asks for basically.

Why does proof by induction work?,1606381438,"I'm not a mathematician, but I'm comfortable enough with mathematical jargon to understand potential explanations. 

Typically when proof by induction is explained, some weird analogy is given about dominoes, stairs or staircases. If you can, please avoid using analogies in explaining this...  no matter how much they are thrown at me, I can't make a connection between these examples and why induction is a valid proofing technique. 

My understanding is that proof by induction is often used for problems where we want to prove that something is true for an arbitrary integer ""k"". To accomplish this, some base case is proved; and then we assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary integer ""k"", and we prove that it's also true for ""k+1"". The latter is what I often have issues with... the fact that we're assuming to be true, the exact statement that we're trying to prove in the first place. Hence, why is this approach a valid way to proof something about an arbitrary ""k"". 

Is ""show it's true for base case; then assume it's true for 'k' and prove it's true for 'k+1' "" just another way to formulate the original proof statement?

Help with Azul combinatorics,1606361863,"I've been playing the tile setting board game Azul recently and it inspired a question that has plagued me for the last couple days. How many different starting draws possible in the game?

Here is how the starting draw works: There are 5 factory mats that are populated with 4 tiles each. Each tile can be one of 5 colors.

The game goes on by each player picking a color and a factory mat and picking up all the tiles of that color from that mat, though that isn't too important.

Its not too hard to calculate how many different permutations there are of this: There are 5^4 possible color permutations for each mat.

However, I want to know how many unique starting positions are out there in terms of strategic choice. For strategy the colors and the order of the factory mats can be interchanged without changing the composition of strategic choices. 

Basically it boils down to the count of a set of matrices that are 5x5 (factory x color) which have rows that sum up to 4 and which are unique ( there rows and columns can not be transposed to make a matrix already in the set)

So far, I've found a few analysis textbooks that I might like. Those books are *Analysis I* by Tao, *Real Mathematical Analysis* by Pugh, and *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* by Rudin. However, I've recently also found the *Analysis* series by Amann and Escher, which takes a top-down, abstract approach to analysis. Supposedly, the authors want to teach it in such a way that a student only needs to learn the concepts and definitions once, whereas a typical ""bottom-up"" approach defines concepts as needed as they move from ""specific"" spaces to more general ones.

The thing is, I really only want to stick to one approach as closely as possible because I only have so much time. If I choose the bottom-up approach, I want a complete and thorough construction of the real numbers like in Tao (although I have heard there is some circularity in his construction) and then move on to Pugh or Rudin. Amann and Escher also has a thorough construction of the real numbers, but as mentioned before, their approach diverges from a typical course. Whatever I choose, I feel like there is going to be an opportunity cost.

Choosing the bottom-up approach might be conceptually easier at first. However, I might be missing out on the opportunity to see analysis from the point of view of a modern, 21st century mathematician (at least as advertised by Amann and Escher). Additionally, while the concepts in this approach may be easier, the proofs are not necessarily so. Using relatively simple machinery to prove things may obscure a big picture view that would come as a simple consequence of more complicated machinery.

On the other hand, a top-down approach (supposedly) allows important results to fall out relatively easily from the definitions, which may outweigh the cost of conceptual difficulty. However, I worry that I may be missing out on problem-solving skills that a bottom-up approach might offer. For example, such an approach would train my ability to solve problems by solely using the properties of a given system that I'm in. Yes, properties that hold in general obviously also apply to specific systems, but those feel like ""sidestepping"" the problem. Of course many mathematicians do that, but I would like to cleave to the original spirit of the problem, loosely speaking, at least for the sake of learning.

Based on what I've written, what do you think is the ""ideal approach"" to self-study real analysis? This may involve a related discussion on pedagogical philosophies. Some people may prefer historical motivation, while others might think these books are too chatty and prefer strictly logical, self-contained treatments. As an avid reader, I like the context that motivation provides, but I'm not opposed to following a slick, clean treatment instead if that's easier.",math,Sour_Drop,False,/r/math/comments/k17hur/ideal_approach_to_selfstudying_real_analysis/

Making it hard,1606335497,"How do you make something simple sound complicated and hard, making yourself sound like an absolute nerd?

I am not posting this in short questions, as this can really vary between things. My current example is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/grssk/comments/k0rxqn/familps/gdl3hfo?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share&amp;context=3) post and that comment there. For that specific thing (having 5 out of 6 OR 0 out of 6 OR 5 out of 7 (""psi"" could be counted as two letters technically) etc) could we possibly use the Greek letters in our favour? What else can we do with it?

I'm sure there's a ton of other situations where stuff can be made sound complicated, starting from just actually writing the stuff or using professional words. Have you ever wondered the same, or have you had any experiences with this?

Also, just as a weird flex and as an ""example"" (it's more about the flex really), here's what I'd do in phonetics, a totally different thing, if asked the same about the phrase ""quite a nerd"": In broad (""simple"") transcription, you could just write it as /kwait a nɜːd/ (/ɜ/ is the vowel e.g. in ""bird""), but as narrow (""complicated"" or ""detailed"") transcription goes, I can make it [kʼwɑɪ̯c̟̆̚.t̺͆ʼ ɑ̽̃‿nɜ̹ɜ̝͗̑ʷd̺̊ʼ], which sounds exactly the same when I say it, but looks very complicated indeed (I can explain it all if you want to!)

How to create a plot to look at best damage multiplier from best ration from Crit chance and crit dmg? that we have in various games? to see as plot line for perfect ratio between both crit values?,1606325093," 

I am trying to draw a plot on Wolframalpha or googles plot and i am stuck, it should be easy but i just cant get to it

Like Usually the formula for general damage would be(if i am not wrong here ):

Base attack(BA) \*\[1- crit chance(CC)\] + Base attack \[Crit chance(CC)\*Crit dmg(CD)\]

And damage multiplier from the crit values should be

**1-CC+(CC\*(1+CD) )**

So if we have 20% CC and 50%CD the dmg multiplier would be: 

1-0.2+(0.2\*1.5)=1.1 or a 10% damage increase 

Now ofc increasing any of it will increase the whole result 

But i want to see is make a graph or plot line to show how the line goes up for highest result possible from that formula, or is wrong for graph/plotline and better in table view with like 10% increases?

Like X axe being crit Chance and Y Crit damage?

Like looking something like this:

[https://imgur.com/zVSrsbq](https://imgur.com/zVSrsbq)

PS: And if it needs more data, lets say it starts with 5% CC and CD at 50, but can start from 0 also since eventually will get to that value i guess?

Is just i remember from Diablo 3 that the ratio of % for CC:CD for best outcome was to keep it 1:5

But in genshin impact is considered 1:2 and i dont know why because they act in same way with damage ingame

I mean the data is all there, but im just like *wth is wrong with me that i dont see it*

I tried to replace CC and CD as its own C=X and CD=x\*2 for the 1:2 relations (Like if have 40% CC than need to have 80% CD

And for 1:5 relation side by side?

I timed my girlfriend’s writing speed and she wrote at about 0.54 zeroes-per-second, and we determined that it would take around 41 trillion years just to get to the twentieth of the 100 zeroes in the power of googol so is it even possible to determine the rate the robots would have to write at in order to write a googol zeroes in 100 years?",math,JCM1728,False,/r/math/comments/k0kjci/fun_question_regarding_a_googolplex/

How to prove that a nonlinear system of equations has a solution?,1606274681,"I'm looking at the system {(f\_x)(g\_y)=(f\_y)(g\_x),  ∇f·∇g=-1} for a proof and I'm really not sure how to approach it (where f\_y is the partial derivative of f with respect to x). Normally, I would use substitution, but I've substituted in the partial derivatives over and over and never gotten something that stands out to me as an identity which might prove the existence of a solution in all cases.

"Discussing Living Proof: Winning by Impression, by Robin Blankenship",1606237211,"In this weekly thread, we discuss essays from the joint AMS and MAA publication [**Living Proof: Stories of Resilience Along the Mathematical Journey**](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf). To quote the preface:

&gt;This project grew out of conversations with students about the difficulties inherent in the study of mathematics  ... Math should be difficult, as should any worthwhile endeavor. But it should not be crippling. The ability to succeed in a mathematical program should not be hindered by a person’s gender, race, sexuality, upbringing, culture, socio-economic status, educational  background, or any other attribute.  
&gt;  
&gt;... As you read this, we hope that you will find some inspiration and common ground in these pages. We trust that there is at least one story here that you can connect with. For those stories that you cannot relate to, we hope that you will come to better appreciate the diversity of our mathematical community and the challenges that others have faced. We also hope that you will laugh with some of our authors as they recount some of the more absurd struggles they have faced. In the end, we hope that you are motivated to share your own stories as you learn more about the experiences of the people in your own mathematical lives.

We will read and discuss individual essays from **Part III: Can I Really Do This? How Do I Muster Through?**

&gt; When looking back, many moments in which we all struggle end up being isolated moments in time, but when we’re *in* those moments, it can seem like an eternity! It is hard to *know* deep down that it *is* possible to get through those moments, and sometimes the best advice any of us can give others is to talk to someone else, whether it be a family member, a trusted friend, the professor for your class or just one you’ve formed a bond with, or someone who’s been through a similar struggle in the past. 

The essays can be [found here](http://www.ams.org/about-us/LivingProof.pdf).

This week's essay starts on *page 81* and is titled

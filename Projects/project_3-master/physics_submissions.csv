The most amazing 'ordinary' physics-related thing I have ever seen,1617043904,"There is nowhere else I can take so benign and incredible a story, hopefully someone will find it entertaining. 

So I'm walking to the shop and I see a guy from an electrical company arm-deep in my building's garden. He is doing something with a pneumatic wrench, and on I go...

Coming home, there's now three guys, and they have attached an enormous T-shaped....thing, like ratchet for taking off a car tire, but chest high at the cross of the T. One of the guys promptly hurls himself into it... and not a budge. 

At this point, one of the other two slots in a gigantic crowbar into the end of one arm of the T (they were like square &amp; hollow on the inside, so the crowbar slotted in perfectly). Then, with one pushing from either side, with God knows how much torque being generated by so huge a fulcrum... nothing happens. 

I actually had to stop and talk to them. They were like ""WOW."" I was like ""I'm sorry, that was ridiculous,"", they're all ""Yup, that is crazy, it must be really rusted in"", I'm like ""Yes.... but that was ridiculous"", and they're all ""It really was.""

And off I went, in total amazement!!! The incredible power of rust!!!",Physics,CleganeForHighSepton,False,/r/Physics/comments/mfwkjs/the_most_amazing_ordinary_physicsrelated_thing_i/

What's a career in physics like? Should I switch to engineering?,1617043817,"I'm having trouble in making a hard choice. I'm currently in a biophysics and biochem program and the reason is because I really like physics, chemistry, and bio, but most of all I love quantum mechanics. The problem is, I really enjoy the content but I don't really see myself being a professor or researcher.

How common is it for someone with a physics degree to find success. What if they only have a bachelor degree?

I'm fine with a career as an engineer, as I enjoy the problem solving, critical thinking, creativity, and the salaries are attractive. The problem with engineering is they don't go as deep into the sciences as I enjoy.

My two choices now are to:

1. Just switch into engineering and maybe learn about physics etc as a passion.

2. Stay in my program and do a masters in engineering afterwards if I really want to. Cons: more time and money spent in school, uncertainty with my future career.

Question about an analogy in The Elegant Universe by Brian Greene...,1617043511,"In the section an special and general relativity Greene has an analogy/explanation for time dilation.  He says that if you're moving at a fixed speed headed north and you accelerate slighty east, your progress north with slow as you're now using some of that speed to travel along a different axis.  (Makes sense.)  Similarly if you're moving at the speed of light through time and begin to accelerate through the spacial dimensions then youre progress through time will be slowed as youre using some of your speed to travel different axis.  (Still makes sense, but here's the question.)  Is the line ""travelling at the speed of light through time"" simply part of the explanation or is that literally how we understand it to work?

How much energy per hour does a solar panel generate? (HELP),1617031409,"I've been trying to wrap my head around the solar panel energy physics but I need your help to figure out where I'm going wrong.

There are no known physical models able to describe temperatures greater than or equal to TP. 

Quantum works by things having more or less number of possible states (amplitudes of different positions in a wavefunction of many dimensions) than usual.

Hot things have more number of possible states, but maybe less chance of each of them, like a molecule of boiling water can be bent at many different possible angles and can move to many possible positions compared to a molecule of frozen water which can bend and move fewer ways. Heat is vibration at very small sizes but may also be superposition of such vibrations aka vibration in more dimensions, and each qubit is a dimension.

Physics is mostly or completely unitary, meaning the same number of possible inputs and outputs, things happening at now minus epsilon time vs now plus epsilon time. Unitary physics can be seen in playing a video backward and it still appears to obey the laws of physics except for friction.

Number of possible states in an X choose Y is symmetric. Number of possible states is not just in physics. Its are pure math concept. If there are 7 green balls and 3 blue balls (which we will count as identical if they are the same color), rolling around a curved surface where theres 10 holes for them to get stuck in, and you shake that all up, the balls start rolling, bounce on eachother chaoticly, and end up in (10 choose 3) = 120 possible states, combos of color ending up at which hole. That is the same number as (10 choose 7) = 120. (x choose y) = x!/(y! * (x-y)!). Its 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 / ((7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) * (3 * 2 * 1)) = 120 either way. (7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) is the bigger one and cancels out leaving 10 * 9 * 8 / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. There are 120 possible states of where the physical system of balls will end up, if we count balls of the same color as equal (like happens in Bose Condensate), and if we are only counting states where it has near lowest energy. In reality you have to count a small wavefunction amplitude for the balls sometimes bouncing up out of their holes cuz of an earthquake or heat hits them just the right way, and count the number of states of them not being frozen at absoluteZero in the holes but having multiple possible states within each hole.

The number of possible states in an X choose Y is symmetric, so as you increase Y from 0 to X/2, (X choose Y) increases, but past that (X choose Y) decreases.

Theory: Temperature is symmetric between 0 kelvin and [either 1.416784*10^32 kelvin or 2 times that], because if you pack enough energy into a planck size volume, its number of possible states of that volume reaches maximum. 1.416784*10^32 kelvin is either (X choose (X/2)) or (X choose X).

"TV style immortality by storing all the data in your body with physics! (Spoiler, it doesn't work very well)",1616988118,"Tl;dr: A lot of recent tv shows have tech that records data about a human and than revives or simulates them. I thought it be fun to see how much data we would need to fully record all the information about a human at one instance. Turns out it is a lot of data, like 8.7\*10\^66 bits of data. The resultant data storage center would be orders of magnitude bigger than our solar system with current data storage technology.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disclaimer: The ideas presented here are by no means fact and are almost certainly incorrect. Feel free to correct my mistakes in the comments.

A recent trend in science fiction is the idea of simulating or resurrecting a person by scanning their body and storing the information. That information can be used to either create or simulation of the person or to resurrect them like in shows such as Black Mirror or Upload. This got me thinking about how difficult it would be to truly save all of the information in a human. So I decided to try and measure the amount of information in a single human.

The first thing to decide is what information to store and what to discard. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that no piece of information is truly irrelevant and therefore every single bit of information needs to be stored as far down as the subatomic level. You may think that this is a little overkill but remember that quantum physics is a weird. Single particle interactions, such as flipping the spin of a single electron can have an unknowingly large effect as demonstrated by Schrodinger's Cat and how the livelihood of the cat hinges on a single radioactive particle. In essence we need to measure all the information pertaining to the smallest particles (the standard model, i.e. electrons and electrons) present within the human body. 

Now that we know that all the information is vital we can start to calculate how much information that entails. A human with a mass of 70kg has roughly 7\*10\^27 atoms in their body. Every atom is composed of electrons, protons and neutrons. Electrons are part of the standard model and are indivisible while protons and neutrons each have 3 quarks (quarks are also indivisible). The first problem we run into is that different atoms have a different numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons. The solution to this is to pretend that any moment, any atom could temporarily turn into the largest known element, Oganesson, which has a staggering atomic mass of 294 or 295 amu depending on the isotope.

We will assume the 295 amu isotope to be safe. To be clear, this cannot happen but we are building our data structure around it to ensure that it could handle a scenario where it does happen. The 295 amu in Oganesson implies there are 295 protons and neutrons and an additional 118 electrons. We have to multiply the 295 by 3 because each proton and neutron has 3 quarks. When you add that to the 118 electrons we come to the conclusion that there is maximum 1003 standard model particles in a the largest single atom. However, there can also be some free floating photons or other particles so we are going to round up to 1024. You may ask yourself, why 1024? Well because there are 1024 bits in a kilobit and data works in binary so this actually will make our lives easier and we would have to use that data anyways. To recap, we have 7\*10\^27 atoms each with a maximum of 1024 standard model particles.

The next task is to find out what data we need to record for each subatomic particle. Well there are 17 particles in the standard model so we will need 5 bits (again base 2) to represent what type of particle each recorded data point is. For each particle, we will also need to record its location and velocity, which can be broken down into its x,y,z components. The question then becomes, how precisely and accurately can we record location and velocity? 

For simplicity's sake let's say that no particle is outside of a sphere with a radius of 2 meters around the human. Using the most precise measurement we could possibly take, the Planck Length, we will achieve the best results. The Planck Length is 1.616255\*10\^-35 meters so in the x, y and z directions there are 4\*1.616255\*10\^35 possible values (4 because the diameter of the sphere is 4 meters). If you are confused about this try thinking about a graph. Instead of the gridmarks of the axis lines increasing by a meter or centimeter at a time, they increase by the extremely small 1.616255\*10\^-35 meters per tick mark. This would mean that there are 1.616255\*10\^35 different observable locations on a one meter line.

To store a single displacement value we need to use 2\*1.616255\*10\^35 bits of data (half of the number of possible values). We need to do this for the three components, x, y and z. We also need to store information about the velocity. Each velocity has 1.616255\*10\^35 possible values so using our divide by two rule to get the amount of bits to store that information we will need 1/2\*1.616255\*10\^35 bits,. Remember we need to store one value for each component so we actually need 1.5\*1.616255\*10\^35 bits for velocity alone. Now adding the amount of information from distance and velocity, there is 7.5\*1.616255\*10\^35 bits of information to be stored per particle recorded.

Luckily we don't need to record acceleration as this can be calculated from the interactions with other particles present. With 7.5\*1.616255\*10\^35 bits of information per particle and 1024\*7\*10\^27 particles, multiplied by 5 to represent which type of particle, we have a grand total of roughly 4.4\*10\^67 bits of information for one human! 

Now the next natural question is, what would happen if we tried to store it? One of the denser storage mediums we have is the 1 terabyte sd card (8.796\*10\^12 bits), which has a volume of about 1.65\*10\^-7 meters\^3.  Storing all of that information on micro sd cards would result in 5.0\*10\^54 sd cards being used with a volume of 8.2\*10\^47 meters \^3. If this were stored in a perfect sphere, it would take a sphere with a radius of 1.7\*10\^16 meters or 1.8 light years. This would make the data storage center bigger than the Cat's Eye Nebula, the Solar System and Oort Cloud. Or if we were to stack the SD cards one on top of the other, they would be 5.0\*10\^51 meters high or 5.2 \*10\^35 light years high. That is so long, that for each 1231 atoms in the human body that data is recorded, a stack of SD cards with the height of the observable universe (93 billion light years) would be created.

 In other words, copying human beings down to their subatomic particles are is hard and requires a lot of data and we are going to need a good compression algorithm.

Physics IS the purest science more than math.,1616980046,"I have been thinking about this for months now.

Chemistry's basis are the orbits and electronic interactions of elements which work by magnetism, so, physics, biology is the body's chemistry so the same applies.

But there is one science that a lot of people considers the basis of them all including physics, most people will argue that mathematics is the purest form of science and that physics is based on math but I disagree.

I won't deny that math is intrinsic and very important for science and physics (don't you agree, Katy Perry?), however, math allow us to do but one thing in this subject, to Measure, measuring is the comparison of one thing against other, most of the times against an standarized form such as the centimeter, or second or any other metric.

And of course, measurement lead to control, thanks to measuring we can heat things to an specific temperature or cut them to an specific length, etc.

However, that is not necessary for physics to work; yet mathematics without a physical application is utterly useless.

Think about this, if I come to you and simply tell you ""500"" the first thing you might ask me back is ""500 what?"" Meters? Degrees? Dollars? If they don't have a context mathematics do nothing.

But we can have physics without mathematics, we use physics without math all the time, for instance, how much force do you apply to nail a nail on your wall? Who knows right? If it were for an specific application on which knowing that is essential (I don't know, maybe oil digging, perhaps?) Then we would measure it but for most practical applications the math is irrelevant.

Conclusion: Physics GREATLY benefits from math because it allow us to measure thus have control, but math is not essential for physics to work, our cavemen ancestors would use physics for survival but I bet they didn't know anything about mathematics.

We'd be having three sessions every week, **2 Lectures and 1 PSet Discussion,** the timing for lectures is **1:30 PM** UTC and for PSet Discussions it'd be **2:45PM UTC**. Lectures are scheduled on **Fridays** and **Sundays,** where we'd be going through the corresponding lecture notes or/and watch lectures. And we have PSet discussions on **every Saturday** where we meet to discuss the solutions that we all had tried for the corresponding PSet. For every PSet you get around **5-6 days** for submitting the solutions, which are preferably to be sent in LaTeX  but can be fine even if it's handwritten. We recommend [ICTP's Lecture series on Differential Geometry](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLp0hSY2uBeP_2dottSdX0eLPV_but7UAG) which also uses Do Carmo's book so it can be a great companion, we also might need to refer to a number of their lectures for better understanding. 

Everything else regarding the course can be found or asked at #18-950-diff-geo channel in the server or you might just ask me or someone else at #general-chat and you'd be directed to the right place.

Understanding special relativity: time dilation,1615985458,"I just learnt about relativity and special relativity for the first time. 

To understand time dilation, we used the “light clock” analogy. It proposes a device that emits a pulse of light, which moves forwards and reflects of a mirror, and the time taken is measured. When this device is moving , to a stationary observer the light would appear to travel in a triangular shape, and thus travel a farther distance, and thus take more time.

I understand time dilation in the context of this scenario, as I can easily imagine the movement of the light pulse. However, when it comes to scenarios involving people (e.g. the twin paradox) I find it harder to understand as it is not as simple as imagining a single beam of light.

I understand all the maths, but how do you guys picture time dilation?

Also, When thinking about “time travel” by moving away from earth at the speed of light, if the moving observer came back to earth would they appear older than everyone else, or would everyone else appear older to them? I assume their cells would not age at a faster rate, and thus would they ageing effect be caused by light “catching up” to one of the observers?

If a Great White Shark was waiting and swimming up at full speed with its mouth open, would he go through the shark? Keep in mind in this scenario, the shark has broken the surface tension of the water and is just above the water level. So he is going directly into the mouth of the shark.

Question about how force is calculated with different gravities,1615956103,"The calculation of force has always been confusing for me since it isn't based on weight but mass. However, I believe weight has to have something to do with that. On earth, I could never hope to lift a rock that weighs 200lbs, but on the moon that rock only weighs 33lbs, so it would be quite easy to lift. The confusion though comes when that rock rolls down a hill. On earth it would take a lot of force to stop a 200lb rock rolling down a hill, but surely it wouldn't take the same amount of force on the moon.
This is my question: if a boulder rolls down a hill accumulating speed till it hits 40mph  then rolls along flat ground maintaining its speed for a short distance until it hits a large spring to stop the boulder's momentum,  what would be the difference in spring recoil difference to stop that boulder's momentum on Earth, the moon, and Jupiter. Speed, Mass, and air/ground resistance are all constant. The boulder and spring are constant. The only change is in the weight of the boulder due to gravity. If more force is required to stop the boulder due to a higher gravity, then the spring should recoil further back to compensate, so I would like to know if my theory is correct.

Covid Vaccine For Physicists :-),1615936870,"This is what a physicist should see in the ""vaccines"" that are being administered:

We know that if you inject pure water in people, about 95 percent of them will not show signs of illness by Covid 19. We know that if you do not inject them with anything at all, about 95 percent of them will not show signs of illness by Covid 19. In both cases only the elderly and those with several medical and genetic pre-dispositions will start to show signs of illness. So claims of ""95% effective"" vaccines really doesn't show that getting this vaccine will be much better than nothing.

And vaccine itself might not be the correct way to deal with Covid in the first place. Covid rides on aerosols which travel inside air for hours. There are many effective \_physical\_ ways to manage these particles in air as well as on surfaces in closed spaces.

Now for those who do get sick by Covid, what happens to them? The only untampered and meaningful data that was presented to public came out before testing began. After testings, they smeared the data with test results. But before adding testing results the data indicated that if you get the virus and start showing difficulty breathing, cough, and high fever, you have 62% chance to recover, and 38% chance to die from it no matter what the doctors do or do not for you. That is, this corona virus kills at the same rate as earlier other corona viruses did in earlier epidemics.

And who, when acquired the virus, starts to have breathing difficulty, cough, and high fever? The 5% or so in general population that are either elderly or have genetic and medical pre-dispositions to the virus. How many among this 5% population will die? 38% of them. This is reflected quite well in the death data that is being published daily. Presently out of 30 million Americans who've had exposure to covid 550000 have died of it. This percentage is very close to 38% of 5% of population who have predispositions to this virus. 

Conclusion: 

If you're among high risk groups do give the vaccine the benefit of the doubt and get it, cause 38% death rate among your group - if you start to show the illness - is quite daunting. If death rate in coming months (and years) dramatically decreases among your group then this vaccine will indeed prove to be effective. If death rate in your group stays around 38% then the vaccine is as good as pure water injected in you.",Physics,BetomarButnist,False,/r/Physics/comments/m6mbaj/covid_vaccine_for_physicists/

I am a postdoc working on quantum theory (solid-state physics to be precise) and I am supervising master and PhD students. Being stuck at home during the pandemic has motivated me to finally record an online course I have been planning for a long time: 

[""Quantum Physics from Beginner to Expert""](https://www.udemy.com/course/quantumphysics/?couponCode=PROMOTION).   
I have decided to give something back to this great subreddit, so **the udemy course is free for you**. Just use the code: *PROMOTION*  
I hope you find the course interesting. It contains *9 hours* of recorded lectures, several quizzes and even an optional programming lecture. The first part is loosely based on a 1 semester quantum mechanics Bachelor course. This is mainly for Bachelor students but also for people generally interested in quantum physics. In the second part, I briefly discuss relativistic quantum mechanics so that we can derive the electron spin and use it for quantum computing. I tried to make this course **interesting for everyone: beginners to advanced students**. You can find more on the landing page of the course. 

**Structure:**  
1. Why do we need quantum mechanics?  
2. The Schrödinger equation  
3. Solving stationary examples  
4. Programming Session  
5. More theoretical background  
6. Second quantization: The harmonic oscillator

Hello everyone, I'm a 4th year undergrad student currently doing a bsc thesis on conformal field theory and it feels impossible to understand anything that's going on, let alone make any progress. When I first started, I was reading about QFT and lecture notes on CFT I could generally follow the things I was studying (even though I found it very tough) and made slow but steady progress. Right now, though, my advisor has given me a problem and I struggle to even comprehend what the equations mean and what I should be doing. I've felt this way for a few weeks now and I don't know what to do about it. It's killing my motivation to study for my other courses, too. I hate to say it, but I don't see any way I'll be able to complete the thesis by May/June. Even if I could, there's no way I could answer the commitee's questions when/if I present it. I've thought about dropping the thesis (I'll be most likely be able to graduate by completing courses), but I don't really want to do it unless I can take it no more, since:


1. I don't want to give up, as I've spent a lot of time on it, and 

2. My advisor wrote me a reference letter and I submitted a summary of what my thesis is on for a masters application to a pretty good university, to which I got accepted. So I'd feel like a fraud if I dropped what was probably an important part of my successful application.


I'd like some advice/similar stories/whatever you think may be useful on what to do. I was very excited when I first started this, but now I want nothing more than for it to end, I've never felt this burnt out from my studies before :(

In the process of reaching the singularity, the entering matter's information loses its location identity, but not its energy equivalent. A variation of the model posits the NORG fields are reintroduced into the universe at antipolar sites to the black holes in low density areas of space.
Both models state that the process is instantaneous across space in a manner similar to quantum entanglement.The  density of the matter in singularities reaching infinity becomes equal to the anti-density of dark matter and the location of the matter becomes the non locational state of the vastness of dark matter. Time stopping at the singularity is related to the instantaneousness of the dark matter's reintroduction as well.  What the theory proposes to investigate is the rate at which dark matter appears to be inflating the universe and how closely it corresponds to the rate at which matter is entering singularities across the universe.",Physics,5cr4m,False,/r/Physics/comments/m6auwq/is_my_hypothesis_valid_for_investigation_does_it/

Power Needed by a Table Saw (or Dad’s Physics Question),1615857268,"My 90-year old father called me today with what he describes as a physics problem. Personally, I think there are forces at work (no pun intended) other than physics, but he’s serious about the question. 

In his apartment, he has a small table saw, which he uses for small projects like making dollhouse furniture. His little workshop is in the room my folks use as an office, together with two computers, three printers (don’t get me started on that), two phones, several lamps, and a few cordless power tools that he plugs in to charge. The result is that if he isn’t careful about what’s powered on, the circuit breaker flips and he catches heck from mom. 

So he calls me tonight with this. He wants to use the little table saw to cut a piece of wood. (Not thick wood, but not thin enough to cut with a knife or hand saw.). He can raise or lower the height of the blade before pushing the wood into it.  When the blade is high, it bites into the wood at the point that is directly below the blade’s center - call it at the blade’s 6 o’clock position. When the blade is low, it bites into the wood at something like the 9 o’clock position. 

The question is this: to consume the least amount of power (to avoid flipping the circuit breaker and annoying mom), should he position the blade high relative to the wood or low?

Undergrad Physics pedagogical question: When to teach the diffraction grating? (What order?),1615839778,"Hello!

I'm teaching Waves and Optics (and Modern Physics) this semester and am trying to decide which order to teach the following:

1. Double (multi) slit interference
2. Single slit diffraction
3. Diffraction gratings

The Knight textbook teaches it 1-3-2, the Serway and OpenStax textbooks teach it 1-2-3.

These phenomenon are all interference and diffraction at some level, so the differentiation is superficial, but I still need to pick an order.

On the one hand, it seems to flow to teach the diffraction grating after the double slit because it is commonly shown as a bunch of openings (500 lines/mm). On the other hand, a diffraction grating is an application of diffraction/interference, so it could just go at the end. It also might work at the end as a sort of ""spiral"" effect to teaching (circling back).

I would appreciate the opinions of some fellow Physicists. Please also upvote for exposure. Many thanks!

But then I thought about how Dyson-Spheres contain particles in a small space - which would lead to Entropy increasing more slowly. Of course, that doesn't really change anything about the lifetime of the star itself, because the fuel is still consumed at roughly the same pace. (Though, I might be wrong about that one.) It did, however spark the question in me, if there were ""doable"" ways of increasing the lifetime of a star.

Multi-verse Theory,1615792741," 

Excuse the extremely bad representation of what's in my head but it's the best I could do.

The conjectures are as follows:

* **Why and how is the mass of a black hole so large?**  
The mass produced in the ""middle"" of a black hole is a combination of the mass of each universe on either side. This equates to a combined gravitational force of both masses in the centre.
* **What happens in a black hole?**  
As you accelerate inwards towards the centre of the black hole, the acceleration towards the centre is enough to propel you out into the universe on the other side.
* **Are there multi-universes?**  
Yes, a black hole acts as a bridge between universes and can apply to an 'n' number of universes with no limit.
* **How did these universes originate?**  
Just as our universe was created; the big bang, these universes had their own 'big bang' explosion in the vast stretch of space where all other universes are located .
* **Where is the space that consists of all of our universes located?**  
In an infinite sequence of universes within universes. This IS our “universe” so anything is possible.
* **Why is this universe portrayed as being flat?**  
To extend from an answer on google, it seems logical that the curvature created by stars, dust, galaxies, etc. are small deviations in the stretch of a flat field, however, black holes can be on any angle between 0-360 that would connect our universe to others. This combination of flat universes created a spheroidal shape of the space that consists of these universes.

How does global warming work as far as heat (like furnaces)?,1615773822,"I read a few weeks ago that the co2 levels where multiples higher, back like 400million years ago, and the temperatures were about the same.

It seems that scientists only refer to the co2 when talking about natural gas furnaces, forest fires, even when they talk about volcanoes. Even engines on cars put of a ton of heat that is blown off with a fan and radiator. 

My question is, where does all this heat  go? Is this a contributer to global warming? Is it such a small amount of heat that it doesn't matter? Is this heat included somehow in the Co2 levels?

Nevertheless, what if the conception of the universe our instinct tells us is correct is nothing but a misconception? What if the mathematical principle that lies under the universe is in fact probabilistic rather than deterministic? That way, QM would make sense, but now Newtonian mechanics wouldn't, unless we assumed every deterministic event is a probabilistic one with a likelihood of such event taking place near to 100%.

If everything can be considered quantum and there is no observer in a quantum system, the wave function would not collapse. For example: I’m sitting in my room, I can see the walls, my bed, laptop, etc but through the door and walls I cannot observe my living room. I know however that if I walk out of my room I’ll be in my living room. Before I leave my room though, objects like the couch or TV or even the floors and walls of the living room would be uncollapsed wavefunctions as they are from my perspective unobserved and therefore “unmeasured”. Would this imply that the world sort of procedurally generates into the classical system we’re familiar with as we move through it and progressively “measure” more? This would also suggest that it procedurally degrades as we stop measuring (Similar to how video games procedurally generate worlds - link to simulations?)

As this is obviously rather absurd, could someone perhaps share some ideas on this?

The O-Ring Guy :-),1615700796,"
People of physics background might think the story behind the explosion of the Shuttle in 1986 was all included in Feynman's
account of it (in Physics Today and later as part of a book he published). But the truth of what happened, including the o-ring story, was brought to the attention of the commission
investigating it by someone else. A bright engineer named McDonald whose team had designed the entire boosters. He had
emphatically opposed the launch, risking his career, but his decision was over-rulled by his bosses.

The entire story was later told in his book, ""Truth, Lies, and O-Rings"" (kind of what only an engineer comes up with for a title). He and his team knew the o-rings stiffen dangerously even at as high a temperature as 53 degrees F. Shuttle had gone through 18 F that night. He knew for a fact fuel will leak out so he never gave his approval to launch. But the stupid Reagan wouldn't want to postpone the ceremony yet another time so White
House pressured NASA to launch.

This matter of McDonald is worth coming up again cause he just died 2 or 3 days ago. An American of the era when Americans actually had the American culture in them, not the present knuckleheadness and/or cronyism. The shit that had started to compile with Reagan himself and his ""cronies.""

Hello, I have come to you at a time of great confusion. 

I was solving a physicist problem involving spinning balls with my friends and this question came up. Imagine a scenario like the one drawn in the diagram. Someone has a ball tied to the end of a string (like a pendulum) and he is spinning it around his finger. I understand that this system is really similar to an orbiting planet or satellite, where its velocity keeps it from falling and it is essentially in freefall. To understand this better I imagined the guy as the earth and the ball as the moon, and I am able to understand why the ball doesn't crash into my finger. But of course, this system has another force to take into account, gravity. So why is it that the ball does not fall towards the earth? I cant see a force that opposes gravity in this system, so what is happening? I was thinking it had something to do with precession but I am not sure at all.

Am I just dumb and this is really simple? Could someone please explain it to me?

"For someone not academically or professionally involved with physics, or science at all, is it worth studying as a hobby?",1615651839,"I love science and philosophy. Always have. I wanted to go into a scientific field when I was in secondary school (I think forensic science was my original choice) but, my insecurities about intelligence shot me down.

However, a growing desire, it's always been there but I am not considering it more seriously, is a want to study science in my own time, specifically physics as I find that the most interesting out of the three broad sciences (physics, biology, chemistry). 

Is this worth doing? Is this possible? How would I achieve this?

What am i missing? Need help with understanding circular motion mechanics/ kinematics etc.,1615585323,"Hello there, first i want to say that i may mix up some terminology, im not 100% sure what the words all mean.

Okay, so what i need help with understand is if its a circle/ circular motion with a constant, or changing velocity. Its about centripetal force and all, and im trying to wrap my head around it. I will explain what i ""understand"", and hopefully someone can help where my thinking fails.

If some obejct is going forward on the ground, without friction, it has a velocity e\_t in the forward direction, normalforce N in upwards direction e\_n, and gravity mg pointing negative in e\_n. If the object is teleported into a circular loop, or just goes up in a loop and then forward again, there are 3 positions i am thinking about when it comes to centripetal force. The lowest position, -90 degrees position, or however you say it, the top position +90 degrees, but also the ""middle"" position of 0 degrees.

So, my understanding is basically that an object with a velocity in circular motion always has a centripetal force pointing towards the center of circle/ rotation, and is given by F=m\*(v\^2)/r. However, as i also understand it, this is just a way of expressing this inwards force/ towards the center force, but that the force that accelerates the object actually comes from somewhere else.

**For example, at the bottom -90 degree position:** 

In direction e\_n, there are only two forces, positive N and negative mg. But this can be *\*expressed\** as N-mg=m\*(v\^2)/r, as circular motion requires a net force inwards, but the force itself comes from the normal force in this case, and its greater than mg, because we require that in order to get a inwards accelleration, but i dont quite get why this is if N is only counteracting mg...

**At the top position +90degrees, its more confusing for me:** 

The only two forces are N and mg, both positive as they are both pointing in the e\_n direction, and since its a circular motion, N has to exist. Otherwise, if N does not exists, it means the object has no contact with the loop, and is in freefall, meaning no circular motion. 

It seems to me like we say that N exists only to prevent a contradiction. Intuitively, that does not make real sense to me, as it seems we are deducing that N must exist, even though there is no force that it is counteracting...? My senses tell me that we DO have to kind of force upwards ""because"" of the velocity of the object but i dont know, all i hear about that is 'nono, that does not exist'... Anyway, here we say that N + mg = m\*(v\^2)/r. Again, we are just saying that the centripetal force is a way to express the net force... 

**Now at the middle position 0 degrees where its even worse:**

So, at this position, i am even more confused. So here, mg is not a part of e\_n at all, it is just negative in the e\_t direction, slowing down the velocity upwards. So the object is in a way just in freefall... Yet, since the object is in circular motion, it must have a centripetal force net force in the e\_n direction. But where does that come from? Well, it must be N again, right? Since circular motion means it must have contact with the loop..? But in that case, where does N come from exactly? N is supposed to just be a counter force, so what force is it countering? So here i guess we just write it as N=m\*(v\^2)/r. 

&amp;#x200B;

But the thing is, tall these centripetal force things, at all positions, seems to imply that the centripetal force isnt pointing inwards at all. Since N=m\*(v\^2)/r, -&gt;-&gt;, N -m(v\^2)/r=0. And that also seems to make sense to me in a way, since we are never actually flying off he loop towards the, and we are never crashing through the loop either. So my senses tell me that a net force has to be 0 in some way....

So what am i to make of this centripetal force? I cant really wrap my head around it.",Physics,bakeywithajakey,False,/r/Physics/comments/m3rwqm/what_am_i_missing_need_help_with_understanding/

Theory for a united model,1615568167,"Hello r/physics,

Here's a theory for you, I wouldn't take it for a fact, but it does seem to meet all criterias we have been looking for, enjoy the read:

A Golden World, and a new Golden Age?

Humans tend to prefer heuristic experiences, by that I mean that our highest degree of perfection would reside in our ability to make perfect choices without exterior help. To achieve such goal with consistency, we must be supported by the understanding of the world that surrounds us so that our decisions aren't based on foggy matter, but a concrete foundation. Thanks to the iteration of all human lives, we have been able to iterate our thinking as a whole to push the limits of our understanding. Layer after layer, we ""peeled"" and tried to see what was further down, further up, further forward, and further backward - until we filled enough space to see. And that is precisely how everything works, it breaks itself down within itself to its next iteration - the chicken and the egg problem of everything.
I am going to prove that under this logical concept, with the assistance of a few tools that were already available, we can recreate a model of the entire known Universe, as well as an infinity of dimensions while keeping within the scope of relativity (General relativity and standard model of physics) yet reconciling them.

The model is simple. We start with a single point as the origin of everything, namely as far as our Standard Model goes, the Higgs boson. The properties of the Higgs make it very volatile, as the origin of everything, it doesn't stay in this state, and arguably, has forever been iterating and we would never be able to ""see"" it directly. That's the first wall we can break, in the theory of the Golden World, there's is an origin of space but there is no origin of time per se. Time, as we know it, measures the linear expansion of our single traditional ""3D"" dimension, the dimensions being infinite iterations of themselves in exponential sets and in every direction - in one direction it expands forward, but can also regress or collapse recursively, which is also true for every direction. 

Concretely, if we go back to our first ever Higgs boson and start iterating, what happens? The example of the result of infinite iterations, we already have plenty of such formulas, and without surprise, one concept that allows particularly for that is Fractal theory - a feedback loop, that creates, by fracturing its original model with different parameters enough to fill indefinitely more or less space with various structured patterns within the boundary of their own scope. That does help us incredibly to understand the development of the world and what the ""expansion"" of the universe is, but the iteration's direction itself will not be linear so I will proceed to the reconciliation of the physics models to explain that.

One sequence, which again unsurprisingly explains the distribution of the iterations, aka Fibonacci's sequence (hence the Golden World), would go as follow:
0 for neutrality or balanced state, 1 is our Higgs bursting into life, 1 is our first Higgs iteration or expansion, 2 gives our next dimension, 3 the next, and so on, increasing complexity of available parameters by providing a child/parent relation, thus enabling for more combination of particles. 
The important concept to understand is Scale. Each iteration gives life to a ""bigger"" object, which in turn will start scaling. The Higgs Boson is thus at the origin of the expansion, like an infinite elastic being stretched in space in the direction of a spiral best described by the Golden Ratio of Fibonacci. This conception of a spiral trajectory of the universe, layered into packed scalable boxes(otherwise known as dimensions), allows for infinite filling of space.


If we let this iterates for a few billion of times, how many Higgs? How many more branches? Branches of branches? We already get something infinitely complex but that's still obeying the law set by/for the master Parent, and gather additional constraints/parameters at each generation. Compositing behavior, layer after layer: Evolution? AI? Cellular division? Thoughts?... Everything is refined iterations of the same thing, that has gone slightly more complex each time, and it keeps iterating. How do we do that without breaking the law of conservation of energy? 
The opposite force to the Higgs expansion is decay, and it is the regression of the fractal division of particles.
So where is gravity? Well, the model already explained it, the time space bend was a non issue in a curved universe. The locality of our models allowed them to work because we were working in the same Layer of our dimension. By layer, I mean that if we consider our known universe (up to the cosmos) to be our dimension, a Layer becomes the unit of scale for this dimension, and each Layer within it has a different gravity center (and slightly different features) and so does each dimension. That is explained by the potential of each Higgs to be the origin of every dimension, being the smallest element of a dimension but the Higgs in the next dimension up would encompass the whole dimension. So time wouldn't be the issue of dimension travel, but Scale would be, and so could fast/time travel? Going down a branch and back up for the first and keeping going down in the other?

We found so far that, a single particle can be responsible for everything complex by iterating itself (dimensions' creation), associating its child(added complexity), and scaling(self contained). It travels in an infinite spiral (simultaneously in all directions) as it scales. There is no start or end, infinity on both end, with an equilibrium reached at every dimension's ""birth"". Dimensions are built on Layers (lower level iterations) that would ""dilute"" from the origin of the dimension.

I could go on to infinity and break down each concept again, in the very same fashion the universe built itself, but the point is that fractal theory and the golden ratio allow us to connect the models and explain many phenomena, we have been doing the very same thing since the dawn of humanity, or life, or beyond, digging deeper into the fabric, adding bits at each iteration to get closer to ""perfection"" or Infinity.


Are we in a Golden World? Apply this very same concept to the structure of anything, and you can make a fractal out of it. I cannot myself express the systematic rules for the iterations at all levels for everyone to understand yet at least, but implications are infinite. 
I have said enough for it to make sense if its an eventuality, if there's a mathematical model that can be derived from this, I am sure it will fill quite a few gaps. If it is all fiction, I am equally happy (happiness can also be explained with this theory if you read the first line again). In the hope that, if I'm not full of my own ****, humanity may iterate faster towards a fair distribution system. Not considered here, but it has equal efficiency to describe social/financial/religious structure without even being incompatible with the latter!

Two theoretical example of the Golden World applied:
A proposed structure of Thoughts:
Thoughts are treated here as a complexity 3 level of building blocks for experience (memory, motion, anticipation)
Obeying the Golden World's theory, we can derive that thoughts are indeed particles. But where would they be located? (Un)Surprisingly, thoughts would be a shared parameter within at least all cells in our body, and is likely to include anything that showcase evolution features - implying a plant could indeed Think, and a virus too for example. 
How would thoughts express itself across all species? Because of the very nature of things, imagine a simple branching evolutionary tree going back to the very first iteration (or root). If that very first iteration was already carrying Thoughts, then each branch further in the chain will inherit a fractal version of it. 
A possible visualization of it, is in brain activity, that would be why some parts of the brain for example, sharing a similar parameter, would react similarly to an interaction with more or less magnitude when solicited - the strength of the emission measured showing the energy needed by the brain to dive into/extract from itself and iterate in the aim of adapting to the next interaction of the same type.
The double slit experiment re-thought
In the current model, we see a fog of possibilities after the proton hit the slit, here's how I would explain it with the Golden World theory, instead of probability to be everywhere, it is indeed everywhere (waves, as we see it - iterations as the model propose it) but separated by a length at interval (something that goes towards emptiness, linked to the fact that Layers dilute as they escape their origin). Now, why is there only one impact then? The first layer to encounter another compatible layer will trigger the collision at the point of impact, remember that fractals tend to make things very irregular, and then you can understand that 2 irregular patterns even if they seem o embrace each other, will only hit at one point if you go at a small enough scale to see it, from there, it return to its original state with the strength of the interaction.",Physics,stankov1c,False,/r/Physics/comments/m3lrvw/theory_for_a_united_model/

Would it be possible to use neutrinos to transmit information in internet?  
We know that they travel almost to the speed of light and interact very poorly with matter, so we wouldn't need any long strand of wire like we have now.   
We have detectors (such as the Super Kamiokande), that can detect all flavour oscillations, so my question is:  
Can we build some ""hotspots"" in some big areas of the world, from/to which the information is sent with neutrinos, and from there use normal wire/fiber optic cable?  


This is more of a thought experiment than a true project, since there are a lot of costs to keep in mind.

I am currently enrolled in a mid-sized public university and have enjoyed the time I have spent studying physics.

I have pursued my degree very slowly largely because of my mental health issues(I am 26 and High School class of 2012).

While I was initially supposed to graduate this spring, the pandemic has been very disruptive to my studies and my mental health regarding my day to day functioning. I had to withdraw from classes last spring and unfortunately it seems that the same will be happening this spring as well. 

If I wish to continue to pursue a B.S in physics I would have to take another 2 years of classes. On the other hand I may already qualify for a B.A. Should I consider taking a B.A. or should I stick it out?

I have a 3.46 GPA and have enjoyed some research experience, notably doing REU research during the summer of 19 made me realize my desire to do physics research as a career.

Question on force and acceleration,1615495159,"We've all been told that for better fuel economy, you shouldn't accelerate fast. It seems intuitive, but I was pondering it on my commute this morning and trying to apply my memory of physics in high school. It seems not to be the case, but maybe someone can help straighten me out.

So, 0-60. For ""quick acceleration"" we'll assume 5 seconds and for ""conservative"" we'll assume 20.

A=Vdelta/Tdelta so for 5 seconds A= 17.93 f/s\^2 and for 20 A=4.48 f/s\^2

Force=Mass \* Acceleration. We'll assume a 2000 pound car.

So the force for the quick start is 35,866.67 (something....not sure the units on this)

and the conservative start works out to 8,966.67

So the quick start takes a lot more force, but, the force has to be applied over time, doesn't it? If it does, then we multiply each one by the time it takes to reach 60 m/h and come out with 179,333.3 (Again, the units escape me at this point.)

So, does that mean there is no difference in energy (total) or, is the time already factored in with the acceleration equation, and that's my mistake to factor it in again?",Physics,cpmoellering,False,/r/Physics/comments/m3066i/question_on_force_and_acceleration/

Force of high pressure water nozzle.,1615401285,"Hello,

I recently came across this problem while conducting some experiments with high pressure spray nozzle. 

# To give a little context to what  I am trying to achieve:

 I am trying to spray 105bar 95C water out of spinning nozzle to the grains falling down the pipe, the jet nozzle is located exactly in the middle of the pipe, to which water hits. I have been struggling to achieve  65C mix of water and grains with high pressure water heater but today I changed the nozzle's size from 0.25mm\^2 to 0.4mm\^2 and lowered the pressure to 80bar.  It seemed to fix this problem.

# Now to the  problem.

Results left me wondering what really causes water to cool down so much when sprayed out of the jet nozzle at high pressure? And how does one calculate at what force will water hit the wall of the pipe? How does the angle of spinning nozzle affects this whole thing?

Can Pressure Alone at room temperature be used to confine Plasma and sustain hydrogen fusion?,1615342012,"I'd like someone more knowledgeable of pressure, heat, plasmas and fusion to weigh in on my idea for sustaining plasma using off-the-shelf parts long term without damaging the parts enabling the fusion.

The pressure at the core of the sun is 1 trillion Earth atmospheres which sustains proton-chain hydrogen fusion into helium. Why not build the apparatus at the lowest point in the ocean which immediately gets you to 1000 atmospheres. Use a large off the shelf pressure-chamber vessel capable of 1000 atmospheres which increases the inside pressure to 1 million Earth atmospheres. Finally, buy another smaller pressure chamber, to be put inside the 1 million atmosphere chamber, and increase that to 1000 atmospheres. In the core you have 1 trillion atmospheres of pressure, there you can use your high energy laser emitter and heat your pellet of solid hydrogen to 100 million degrees. The fusion occurs and heats the surrounding liquid metal, then it's all engineering detail to heat to activation, pump in the fuel pellets, charge and strobe the laser, then pump out the heat from the metal after fusion, to run a turbine.

"Weight Lifting, Calories and Sports Science?",1615317318," 

I was trying to pick the best board to post this, but could not, so I guess I'l just leave it right here. Nowadays I've been wondering about how much we don't know yet about burning calories with exercises, especifically weight lifting, I was trying to find some material on the YouTube, and on the Internet at all, about how sport scientists measure calories burned executing those exercises, and found nothing, the closest thing I've found was a series of Lectures about simple mechanics using body dimensions (not to say it was all estatics). As an Civil Engineering student, I kinda have some ""physics"" perception about things at the gym, like pulley ratio of force in some equipments, or the energy consumption moving or lifting weights, etc.

Some articles say we burn about 300 kcal during an 1 hour workout session of weight lifting, but how do they came up with this number? Do they estimate de energy lost by using the concept of potential energy and kinect energy?

For an example, a 3 x 10reps bench press of 25kg on each side plus a 10kg bar, would give us a total 60kg on each rep, and a total volume trained of 1800 kg. I measured myself that I lift the bar 55cm away from the chest on a perfect form, so using the potential energy formula we can estimate the amount of energy lost to execute the whole movement: P.U.=m.g.h=1800kg\*9,81m/s²\*0,55m =9.711,9 Joules of energy, or about 2,3 kcal per rep.

I know it is an underestimated value, because we have loss of energy by heat generation, and the movement requires energy at each eccentric movement as well, because we are stopping an kinetic energy when the weight goes down, but mechanically this is how we can calculate the energy for each exercise.

So, in the end, does anyone knows where the hell can I find this type of science/studies/references?",Physics,Fit_Fun_7093,False,/r/Physics/comments/m1ducx/weight_lifting_calories_and_sports_science/
Does quantum relative entropy decrease under (unknown) projective measurements?,1615316470,"Lets say we have two quantum states, one is pure, one is not. Lets call the pure one rho and the mixed one rho‘. Lets say we have two projective measurements, lets call them P and P‘

Is S(P rho P || P‘ rho‘ P‘ )) &lt;= S (rho || rho‘) ? 

(Without explaining why): if this could be proven for rho and rho‘ interchanged, this would be fine as well. 

Thank you for your help. If you would lead me to a book where something similar proven could be found, this would be great :)

A high school dropout has a question.,1615281635,"Hi. I’m 19, and I currently work nights at an Amazon packaging facility to pay rent. Tonight, while mindlessly packing boxes, I had a train of thought. My shift is almost over, and I’ve been here for about 10 hours, so I could just be exhausted, but I’m gonna try to explain how it went. 

I started to think about why humans always perceive time as going “Forward”. I think I was packaging a time travel movie. I thought “Well, I guess that would depend on how someone would explain time.” 
I thought about how it’s often compared to a river. But that’s a cliche, and got boring to think about. So I shifted to asking myself “How do I know that time is passing?” 
I answered “Things change. Things happen around me, or with me.” 

That presented an even more interesting idea. 
“Well, if time (or time as we perceive it) can only work when things change or happen... what if those things didn’t exist? What if nothing existed? If nothing is able to change or happen, how would time pass?” 

So my weary mind came up with a probable bullshit answer. 
“Time wouldn’t exist.”

But that would mean that “time” is just “a series of cascading reactionary changes” 
It would mean that time is a *product* of things existing. A result of existence and change.

Is that correct? Is time a product of other things?
Or do I just need sleep?

Real life problem that I needed to solve,1615276648,"As a police officer, I saw a Chevrolet Impala behind a Truck. I saw this car putting on its brake lights every 2-3 seconds and the Impala was approximately  7' off the bumper of this truck. I saw - Tailgating or lawfully referred to as following to closely. Naturally, I knew the guy in the truck didn't enjoy being tailgated so I conducted a traffic stop; only see both vehicles yield to the right lane and stop simultaneously. I pulled beside the two vehicles and saw they had a small rope connecting the vehicles. There was a person in the towed vehicle (No power steering, no power brakes because the car was off). Typically I see a tow strap, and its used in neighborhoods, and though illegal, that's fine. Save the guy a $145 tow and let him move his car around the neighborhood to a better spot. Low speeds, low acceleration and low deceleration circumstances. Fine.  

Now. Going down the highway I see this example posted above at 50 MPH.  Turns out, this guy is a cop too. This is fun. He says he is being safe by using hand signals and the guy in the car behind him is a personal friend. I say, cool. You're friend can't see over your truck, you have literally no distance between your truck and him. Therefore,  anyone who pulls out in front of you, means you slam on your breaks. From prior NHTSA classes, we know the average human reaction time is about 1 and 1/4 of a second. We know any amount amount of breaking other than the slightest deceleration  means he's getting rear ended by his friend. His friends life is legitimately in quite a bit of danger in this setup. He also said his 4,500 LB rated tow rope can withstand anything and won't snap; as to justify his use as not using the additional safety chain cables or chains as required incase the primary method of towing; the rope in this case, fails and there is a backup system in place. I wanted to find out just how little acceleration with drag, or slack in the cable up into the point the truck is at full speed exerts on that cable once the drag is all let out and fully tightens in a rubber band effect or as I call it the moment all slack comes out of that rope and the massive yank factor come, ripping out your rear end and destroying his front at the simultaneous time.

The question I'm begging for help for is, and I did nerd out all night using numerous sheets of paper calculation Force Tension, which finally led to an epiphany --- I want to know, max rated capacity or we can refer to is tension is 4,500 LBS. The car weighs 3,800 LBS. We know that if we have this same strap attached to a 10,000 object, as long as we accelerate very, very slowly, we can tow (for example) a 10,000 LB trailer, boat, or object all day and never come close to breaking the strap under tension. 

I've spent about 16+ hours (wife going, what are you doing up all hours of the night- Physics) trying to calculate this real life scenario. I'm missing time, but you'll understand why.    

&amp;#x200B;

We can conclude F= MA, this is undisputable. If the truck is at a stop light and the car is behind him and adding - there is full, exact tension on rope i.e fully extended much like a physical tow bar between the two; besides overcoming a small amount static fiction of as most people say  is negligible tension on the car's part being towed in neutral (.01 coefficient ration here). I understand the force tension formulas all day. I understand force pull = Tension. However; when I do a diagram for the exact problem I request your assistance for, it goes like this.

&amp;#x200B;

PROBLEM - EQUATION - WHAT DO I USE?

We have a 2,000 KG Car (TOWED VEHICLE LISTED AS UNIT #1) and we have a 2,000 KG truck (UNIT #2). Unit #2 is directly in front of Unit #1. Unit #2 has a tow strap connected to its hitch (Weight rating on this strap is 12,000 KG- Yes, its badass). Its hitch is connected to a metal frame, or rather steel. This strap is connected to the front steel frame of the car. For all intents and purposes, lets also assume this strap is steel and has ""negligible""  flex capabilities. Does this steel have elasticity if pulled on? Probably, but its at a .05 level that I can't even begin to factor this in (the same crumple factor (or distance) a car slamming into a tree head-on with about .05 seconds of crumple zone ""national average"" thrown into the equation.)

&amp;#x200B;

Lets use acceleration as an impressive (3/M\^2). The coefficent factor on the stationary vehicle (UNIT #1) is .01. We know that Force is = to Mass (2000KG \* 9.8 G) = Lets just round up for educational purposes, 20,000. Stationary object has 20,000 N \* its friction because its getting pulled directly horizontally behind Unit #2 at .05 as 100N or, we need a force =&gt; to break the static friction force just to get this 2000KG car moving. So we know resistance is at least 100N to the moving vehicle unit #2.

&amp;#x200B;

Unit #2 has slack in the cable, a lot 3 seconds worth = to 3m/s total velocity achieved after 3 seconds is 9m/s. Unit #2 accelerates off and over 3 seconds at 3/m/s = He has Velocity achieved of 9M/s. but still an acceleration factor of 3m/s.  At the moment of hitting 9M/S. All the slack in the cable is pulled tightly. We now have an acceleration of (9-0)/0) which is impossible everything has some type of elasticity. A car hitting a tree because of crumple zone has an average rate of .05 to crumple = Acceleration (27 M/s)/.05)  = 540 M/s or a 2,000KG car (2,000\*540) = an impressive  1,080,000 N applied to a tree. So we know time is absolutely needed here. The problem is we don't have it. Because I don't know what steel, connected to steel, on steel has in terms of elasticity or crumple factor in terms of a car, we can use in the formula here. So can we inverse it based on the factors and find time? I don't know, thats why I need your help here. 

I'm looking for a way that a vehicle traveling at 9/MS applies its self to a tow strap (snap action as the slag is all drawn up)  vs how the mass of the stationary car can affect the car who is already moving at a velocity of 9m/s as the cable snaps too as all the slack is taken up to. And then factoring in the fact the strap has 12,000 KG - cool, what if it had 3,000 KG of force resistance before it snapped, how much of the stationary vehicle is propelled forward after the snapping action of the rope, breaks before the stationary vehicle had a chance to move forward. Does the stationary vehicle in terms of no flex on either ends of the vehicle instantly match the speed of the moving vehicle who drove by it at 9 M/S? How can we, in a way I could give an insurance agent, these forces applied in this scenario? What formulas do I use, because your normal tension force equation does not seem to apply right whatsoever to these equations. M(A) is a vehicle coming from a stand still with no slack in a rope is nothing. Pass this same vehicle by at 9 M/S. and the rope his an instantaneous of ""I need to accelerate this trailer to match to moving vehicle instantly.

The Scientific Definition of Consciousness,1615268481,"Hi,

I'm the philosopher Saul Celere, who is developing a scientific theory of Consciousness based on the postulate that all the physical Energy created in the big bang possesses Consciousness as a fundamental, intrinsic property.

Here is the scientific defintion of Consciousness on which my theory rests. And please check out the audio essay linked below where I scientifically prove that all the energy of our Universe is conscious.

**The Scientific Definition of Consciousness**

**Requirements**

The Scientific Definition of Consciousness must satisfy the following,

**1.** Be consistent with our scientific observations of the phenomenon of Consciousness.

**2.** Be consistent with all existing, well established theoretical and experimental physics.

**3.** Provide the basis for an expandable scientific physical theory Consciousness.

**4.** Be comprised of both an objective component, as well as a subjective component. The objective and subjective components must be logically connected to one another in such a way that is consistent with the scientifically observed, causal connection between the objectively described and defined physical brain, and the subjective conscious experience subjectively experienced within the brain.

**5.** Solve the Hard Problem of Consciousness.

**Part One**

**Consciousness is an Energetic physical phenomenon.**

All the scientifically observed and defined physical phenomena of our Universe are energetic phenomena. That is to say, that according to modern physics, everything that has physical existence in our Universe has been formed out of the original, basic, physical Energy that was created in the Big Bang event, at t = 0. Physics has only ever described, and is only capable of describing, physical energetic phenomena.

Therefore, we define Consciousness as a physical energetic phenomena of our Universe; the existence of Consciousness is grounded in the existence of the basic physical Energy of our Universe; If physical Energy didn't exist, neither would Consciousness.

**Part Two**

**Consciousness is an intrinsic, fundamental property of all the physical Energy of our Universe.**

The physical Energy created in the Big Bang at t = 0, must have either possessed Consciousness as an intrinsic, fundamental property, or not. If not, then Consciousness must be an emergent property, a property that has emerged out of physical Energy at some time after t = 0. There exist no other possibilities.

Assuming that Consciousness is an emergent property has proven a total logical and theoretical impasse; after a century of scientific endeavour, not a single logical scientific theory of Consciousness has been constructed that solves the Hard Problem of Consciousness. This is strong theoretical evidence that the assumption of emergent Consciousness is incorrect.

In contrast, when we assume that Consciousness is an intrinsic property of all physical Energy, the Hard Problem of Consciousness is immediately solved ( you are conscious because you are formed out of nothing except conscious Energy ) and an expandable, logical and intuitive scientific theory of Consciousness can be very naturally and simply constructed.

Therefore, we define Consciousness as an intrinsic property of all the physical Energy created in the big bang event, and we state,

**The Postulate of Intrinsic Consciousness:** All physical Energy possesses Consciousness as an intrinsic property, and always has since the big bang event at t = 0. In fact, physical Energy is exactly equal to physical Consciousness, **E = C.** The physical Energy of our Universe can take on many different forms, and each form experiences within itself the subjective conscious experience corresponding to that form.

This principle perfectly aligns with our scientific understanding of Energy and physical matter; all matter is formed out of basic physical Energy, and the exact physical properties of any material object depends on the physical configuration of that object. For example, we can form diamond or graphite from the same carbon atoms, and the different physical properties of these two substances depend on their respective physical configurations of the carbon atoms.

Similarly, all subjective conscious states are formed out of physical Energy, and the exact nature of a particular subjective conscious state depends on the physical configuration of the Energy and particles within which the state is subjectively experienced.

**Part Three**

Consciousness is not a purely objective phenomena. The phenomenology of Consciousness includes irreducibly subjective aspects.

Therefore, any purely objective definition of Consciousness is necessarily incomplete.

Therefore, a complete definition of Consciousness will necessarily comprise an objective component, as well as a subjective component.

**The Objective Component of the Scientific Definition of Consciousness**

Since, according to our definition, physical Consciousness is exactly equal to physical Energy, any statement about physical Energy is also a statement about physical Consciousness.

And since physics is the **objective** observation, description and definition of physical Energy, physics is also the **objective** observation, description and definition of physical Consciousness.

Therefore, the technical scientific description and definition of the objective aspects of the physical phenomenon of Consciousness, is exactly equal to the technical scientific description and definition of physical Energy, as given by physics.

In short, when physical Consciousness is objectively observed, it appears as exactly equal to objectively observed physical Energy.

**Part Four**

**The Subjective Component of the Scientific Definition of Consciousness**

**Requirements**

**1.** Must be grounded in observations of subjective aspects of the phenomenon of Consciousness.

**2.** Must be consistent with the scientifically observed causal relation between our objectively defined physical bodies and brains, and the subjective conscious experience that we privately and subjectively experience within our respective bodies and brains.

First we define the Law of Privacy.

**Law of Privacy:** The only way to observe any subjective conscious experience is to be the same physical entity or object forming and experiencing it. Or, subjective conscious experience can only be observed subjectively.

For example, you are the only person capable of observing the subjective conscious experience created by your own physical body and brain. We can observe, scan and dissect your brain on any scale we want, but we will only ever observe the objective aspects of your Consciousness, such as objectively defined particles and neurons etc.

We are never able to observe your subjective conscious experience.

This means that the only subjective conscious experience any scientist has ever or can ever observe is their own.

Therefore, the subjective component of every scientist's definition of Consciousness must necessarily be grounded in their own personal observations, of their own subjective conscious experience.

It is an inescapable fact following from all our experience and investigation of the phenomenon of subjective Consciousness, that *your* definition of Consciousness must necessarily be based on *your* own personal subjective experiences of Consciousness, whereas *my* definition must be based on *my* own personal subjective experiences of Consciousness. ( Denial of this fact is the reason why the science of Consciousness has floundered so fruitlessly, for such a long time. )

Therefore, there exists only one possible definition of the subjective aspect of Consciousness.

**Subjective component of the scientific definition of Consciousness:** At any given time, t, the exact configuration of conscious Energy and particles forming your physical self, including your physico-conscious connections to your local surrounding Universe, subjectively experiences within itself, exactly the subjective conscious experience that you experience at the same time, t.

More simply put, your subjective conscious experience at any moment is exactly the conscious experience experienced by conscious Energy and particles configured into exactly your physical form at that moment.

**Part Five**

**Similar configurations of conscious Energy and particles experience similar subjective conscious experiences within themselves.**

This is proven by biology and neuroscience; conscious Energy and particles configured into an eye connected to a brain experience subjective visual conscious experiences within themselves. The same particles arranged into a stomach connected to a brain experience subjective conscious experiences of hunger and satiety.

If this principle wasn't true it would be impossible to reliably identify different parts of the brain and their respective functions.

This principle of similar forms is how, despite the Law of Privacy, we can systematically deduce the conscious states of different conscious entities under different circumstances. For example, we can tell what type of visual subjective conscious experience a fish, say, experiences based on the objective investigation of its eyes, with reference to our own personal, subjective, visual conscious experience. See my essay on fish consciousness.

**Part Six**

**All individual conscious entities possess Limited Free Will. The Collapse of the Wave Function is a conscious act.**

If all Energy is conscious, then all the basic particles formed out of this Energy are definable conscious entities.

As I have shown in my essays on Quantum Mechanics, the simplest and most logical way of interpreting the experiments of Quantum Mechanics is to assume that each quantum entity is a conscious entity capable of consciously choosing from limited sets of possible future states to instantiate, such as, where exactly to land on a screen, or spin up and spin down in a magnetic field, for example.

See my essays on Quantum Mechanics and Limited Free Will for more a detailed description of Quantum Consciousness.

**Further Considerations**

We can see that this definition perfectly aligns with our scientific investigation of Consciousness.

Neuroscience proves beyond all reasonable doubt that Consciousness is grounded in the existence of physical Energy.

Objective inspection of the brain on all scales proves that subjective conscious experience is objectively unobservable.

And when neuroscientists investigate how changes in the physical configuration of the brain affect the subjective conscious experience of the patient, they must rely on the subjective testimony of the patient herself, in order to confirm the correlations between the objective and subjective aspects of Consciousness.

This definition of Consciousness also immediately solves the Hard Problem of Consciousness, as well as allows for the construction of a simple, intuitive and obvious Physics of Consciousness, including the first intuitive and logical interpretation of the experiments of Quantum Mechanics, which itself, also allows for a Quantum theory of Free Will that perfectly aligns with our subjective conscious experience of Free Will.

But the strongest theoretical evidence for this definition of Consciousness, is that it allows for the construction of a simple, logical, intuitive, expandable and, very importantly, teachable Physics of Consciousness.

I will soon release a self study course on the Principles of the Physics of Consciousness. The fact that any person interested in Consciousness will be able to use the simple principles taught in the course, to develop a simple, intuitive and predictive scientific theory of Consciousness that, also, perfectly aligns with their personal experience of being a conscious entity, will prove the validity of the above scientific definition of Consciousness.

An air based heat pump?,1615249402,"Hello everyone. 

I have a question I was hoping someone might be able to answer.

My question relates to using a hypothetical wind turbine to generate heat by compressing air. If we compress air without cooling it then the temperature increase is proportionate to the energy put into the compressor and so this would be the same in efficiency terms, as just converting the wind energy to electricity and producing your heat from a resistance heater, assuming a 100% efficient conversion to electricity. 

But if we were to cool the compressor so that it (and the compressed air) is operating constantly at say 50 degree C, would it not operate more like an air source heat pump, since the cooling will reduce the pressure and work required? What I am getting at is would this system be subject to only getting a COP of 1 or could it go higher, for a hypothetical 50 degree C temperature output?

I don't think this would work as normal heat pumps / refrigeration cycles use phase change but this is not (quite) so with supercritical CO2 heat pumps. I can't get my head around this fully though. Do these cycles rely on phase change to get COP's higher than 1?

Help choosing a college,1615247220,"Hi guys, I recently got into Binghamton, Stony Brook, and Virginia tech. I haven’t gotten decisions back from my other schools, but it’s looking like I’m most likely going to chose between these 3.

I also have large aspirations in physics, specifically in nuclear research, and Stony Brook based on rankings and their research opportunities on their website is exceptional in that aspect. 

Pretty much my question is, how much does a schools “prestige” matter in terms of an undergraduate physics degree, especially if I’m planning on pursuing a PhD anyways.

Realistic Moon Walker Design- Help Needed,1615242111,"Hi there,   
 This is my first time posting on Reddit about anything at all, so be kind.   
I am a writer and producer working for a digital comic book company. I am currently adapting a book that has been created by someone else into a script and one of the problems that I have encountered is the design of a bipedal transport. The creator has a physics master, and so is pretty steadfast on his ideas, though they do not lend themselves to the aesthetics and I wonder if there are other options we can explore that enable the same functionality but also allow for cooler design work. A professional concept artist would also be able to help with this, though without some good suggestions on the technology etc, then I can't justify hiring one in his eyes.   
 One of the initial aspect that I could do with some insight on is in regards to the occupants stabilisation. The initial design has a kind of cockpit suspended from wires that tighten or loosen depending on the movement of the vehicle to keep the passengers stabilised in the Moon's low gravity. I initially mentioned hydraulic systems, though the creator thinks that they wouldn't allow enough movement. I also suggested a kind of arm with hydraulic systems and gyroscopic stabilisation similar to a camera rig.   


Some of the main functionality of the machine are as follows:

  
bipedal and able to run at great speeds. We are using bipedal birds as the inspiration for this. 

  
Able to pick up objects using one of the legs (I think that this can be accomplished better with dedicated arms)

  
The passengers do not have to drive the machine as such, but it is a transport and so the occupants should have a stable ride.   


In terms of the book, it is in part supposed to be grounded in realism. The narrative is set some time in the near future after an extinction level event forces humanity to try and survive in lunar colonies. The aim is to address some of the issues that we would face as so the technology and solutions should have a real world basis and accuracy. I have attached the initial design (as much as I have been provided) and any thoughts or considerations from people far more qualified than me will be hugely appreciated. The main issue I am considering is the passenger stabilisation issue but there are probably many things that I am yet to think of.   


The quality of these designs is not at modern standard, and that is in part why  I have been brought in as a producer, to update the designs and quality. Keep this in mind when viewing the work. It is old and fairly amateur. The huge disc on top is also a solar panel to power the machine. I think that there are probably better ways of powering a machine of this size too.   


I would love to talk to someone with some insighth in further detail. If any of you guys and gals can help me then I would be hugely appreciative.

discussion on interference of waves,1615225778,"Short description: My physics teacher says when two identical waves superimpose in same direction, then only we call it interference. If it superimposes in opposite direction to make a standing wave or at any angle other than zero, it's called superimposing of waves but not interference.

Long description: He was teaching us standing waves and said that in standing waves when two identical waves superimpose in opposite direction, the resultant amplitude is always greater than both the waves. then I raised a question that what if they interfere destructively? the amplitude should become zero because both the identical waves will cancel each other but he said that I should revise the previous definitions again properly (I missed the class in which he taught interference of waves btw). I searched on Wikipedia and I don't think the Wikipedia page says that waves should have same directions to interfere. (according to my english atleast). I didn't say anything because I can't argue with him about this topic as we are studying in a ""crash course"" and he has to finish the syllabus asap.

Please correct me if I'm doing anything wrong.

PS:- 1. I'm not saying I'm correct but I just feel like interference and superimposing are both same things. He is my teacher, he has much more knowledge than me but maybe he is lacking in explaining it properly.

Blue light glasses fake? Help me figure this out please,1615127822,"My doctor told me that I should look into getting blue light glasses for sleep about three months ago and when I got them and put them on, I immediately had the feeling something was wrong. They were completely normal clear lens glasses and I was confused on how this could possibly help me. I’ve done some research on the documented effects of blue light on eyes and the claims that these blue light glasses companies make and so far my conclusion has been that any glasses that aren’t tinted yellow orange or red won’t help your eyes. 

I’ll get into my findings next but first I wanted to say the reason I’m making this post is because I’m hoping people who know more about optometry and physics can weigh in, correct me or corroborate this information.

Companies that sell clear lensed blue light blocking glasses claim that blue light from screens is harmful for retinas, can cause macular degeneration, head aches and eye strain. They also say that blue light makes it harder to sleep and that’s the only issue I really found with it. Here is a reference I used: https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/will-blue-light-from-electronic-devices-increase-my-risk-of-macular-degeneration-and-blindness-2019040816365 

Now the only issue I found to be a real problem with blue light from screens is the issues it can cause people relating to sleep and this was why I started looking into these glasses in the first place. Blue light is very important to regulate our circadian rhythm and naturally we get blue light from the sun as blue light is part of white light. So the LEDs in screens emitting white and blue light messes with people circadian rhythm and keeps them awake. So it doesn’t make any sense that if I were to put on glasses meant to block blue light then I would still be able to see the color blue. This is my understanding that others I’ve talked to (who both own expensive blue light glasses) disagreed with. They said that it “blocks a percentage of the blue light” and that “it’s blocks wavelengths of blue light we can’t see.” This to me didn’t make sense because as I understand is blue light is in our visible light spectrum and if some of the blue light was blocked wouldn’t that mean things just looked a little bit different? So I did some more research to see if there is some UV light hurting our eyes that I should know about and I didn’t see anything but someone please tell me if this is a thing. Of course the opposite side of the spectrum is IR light which can affect our eyes as like lasers but that’s unrelated.

System for recycling water in type of a loop,1614718593,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9ub22yi7cok61.png?width=985&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5efbb54c8ad258ccdb7a7a8e65ec2f6c1552a801

We have two wooden paddles, arranged like shown in figure 1. One is down and other is up in each left and right sides. Now, let's say the left side is filled with water. So When the water flows down, it pressures the paddle down. But the paddle that is already down in that part of the segment, goes up because the water helps it float up. The water that is coming down from the left side. That's the concept.

We have a cap on both sides beyond which the paddle cannot go up. So the water starts to overflow on one side and starts to drip down through the paddle to the other segment thereby completing the loop on one side. Same thing repeats on other side, and creates a loop.

If you didn't quite get it. Try with help of the figures:

In Figure 1 the water is flowing down from the left segment to the right. The paddles are marked as 1 and 2 respectively. So the filling water is pulling the paddle 2 down.

This is continued in Figure 2. The forces at play are showed on the paddle2. The water that is pulling down paddle 2 is at the same time floating the paddle 1 up.(The paddle that is at the bottom of the right segment). That force is shown in Figure 3. Where water is floating the paddle 1 up. This implies this paddle 1 is going down on the right side. Thereby decreasing the level required for water to go down on the LEFT side. The lower paddle 1 goes, the more water flows to the right segment.

For this to occur imagine the top side view of the system

https://preview.redd.it/jz9985h8eok61.png?width=291&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a42dde6f0b409e4a5541e68a620ff9d88aba964b

So there is an inner connectivity which allows the two paddles to be at different sides in the same segment. One allows water beneath it, the other allows water over it, in one turn.

Explained further:

Suppose the water is filling up in the left segment. Paddle A is allowing water go through it only. So the water starts filling up in the right segment through the top right half of the system. This pushes down Paddle A. But water flows from top right to bottom right, as that area will be open already. As the water fills up Paddle B starts floating up.

I have in no way of verifying the system, guess I need to install some software and make the damn thing. But anyone can guide me on this, as I'm not a physics genius, just enjoy Water and Earth.",Physics,Ill_Fisherman8352,False,/r/Physics/comments/lwcb46/system_for_recycling_water_in_type_of_a_loop/

[Question] Can counters/timers be used in the calculation of one-way speed of light to overcome clock synchronization challenges?,1614711489,"I am very new to the topic and the area, please be gentle :) I am not sure this is a close-ended or conceptual question either.

I stumbled upon this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k), ""Why The Speed Of Light\* Can't Be Measured"" in great detail, why we can't measure it accurately, clock synchronization, and time dilation challenges in measuring the speed of light one-way. I read Relativity Theory many years ago and somehow the foundations still stuck with me, I get why it is impossible to sync those clocks.

We currently use the - roughly - round trip divided by two as the C, which made me think of a thought experiment, if we were to use counters/timers in the following way, could we not measure the one-way speed?

The experiment would be simple enough to change direction and empirically verify if the direction mattered to the speed.

I have tried to summarise my experiment and thoughts in the following 10 minutes video - most of it me trying to articulate the thoughts rather than the experiment itself.

Did I simplify too much? Especially with the light resource and emitting, since light photos are a mystery to me regardless of how much I read.

Did I make idiotic assumptions about the physics involved?

[https://youtu.be/9SypHp8pcS8](https://youtu.be/9SypHp8pcS8)

I can attach the PDF version of the slides too if it is more helpful.

Part 2, From the original video: 

The mars challenge would be resolved similar way.

1. You start two counters same instant(ish), give one to your astronaut to take to mars.
2. When the astronaut is on mars you send a radio signal and note your counter time.
3. When the astronaut receives the signal, notes the time on their counter.
4. The astronaut sends a signal and noting down the time on their counter
5. When you receive that signal you note down the time on your counter.
6. The diffs give you roughly the speed of transmission and then with distances included, the speed of light right?
7. You could start shining a laser on the counter instances rather than radio.

I know there are actual geniuses in this world and the reason why we haven't proved the one-way empirically is round-trip/2 is empirical enough and we haven't seen any evidence to prove otherwise.

It would be a waste of time and resources that could be spent on much better things, but the question is could we actually on such a stupid setup and if not, which parts I have got wrong and actually improve my knowledge on those points.",Physics,cenotaphx,False,/r/Physics/comments/lw9o7y/question_can_counterstimers_be_used_in_the/
Sign convention (and conversion) for the imaginary part of the complex refractive index.,1614710793,"Hi all,

Now the answer to this question may be very obvious/straightforward, but please remember that I'm a lowly chemical engineer so my familiarity with complex numbers and refractive indices is not so hot.

Basically I'm working on a project which requires some calculations of Mie scattering. To do this I need to input the refractive index and extinction coefficients (i.e. real and imaginery parts of the complex refractive index) of the medium of interest across a range of wavelengths into a calculation.

I seem to have bug myself into a big pit of confusion when it comes to the complex refractive index and which values to use. The calculation I'm inputting into requires the imaginary part of the complex refractive index (i.e. the extinction coefficient) to be negative - in other words, it is using the convention n\_bar = n - ik.

However, sources of the required data seem to be split between using n\_bar = n + ik **OR** n\_bar = n - ik and trying to work out what I can/can't use, or how to convert one to the other (or if I even need to) , is giving me a stress headache.

Can anyone explain what is going on please? Am I over-complicating it?

As a quickly googled example: [THIS](https://omlc.org/calc/mie_calc.html) calculator requires the imaginary index to be negative, however [THIS](https://refractiveindex.info/) data set gives it as positive while a paper I've read gives data as negative (see below)

so what is the counter effect of all of these things nowadays? no risks = no progress

no one is moving forward mentally, everyone stuck in a slow motion loop of their lifes and feeling like this has been the longest year in their lifes. why? because in our minds it was.

perception of time, yes it is very tricky for everyone...but what if this is something measurable? what if this is based on a measurable time scale and we never even thought about looking for it? what about the quantum physics that suggest a lot of theorems about how sub-particles are behaving completely different than the Newtons physics. i would love to learn more about these kind of studies and i'm honestly looking for good read that this community can offer.

Triple pendulum ODE integration with Runge-Kutta method,1614014016,"Hi, firts of all I'm sorry if this isn't the right sub to post this, but I am sure someone here knows about basic computational methods for physics systems...

In order to complete an assignment for uni I decided to simulate (integrate) the dynamics of a triple pendulum, using methods learnt from previous classes.

Due to the lack of details on how to achieve this, I went brute force, solved the Lagrange equations for the angular accelerations and put those newfound forces in a runge kutta algorithm I wrote on c++.

Now, everything works fine, especially for low energy initial conditions... However for some reasons starting with higher values of the angles (aka higher initial energy) will cause the system's energy to diverge in mere seconds (it jumps 11 orders of magnitude), **even if i previously learnt that runge kutta methods are known to keep it's average value constant**.

The only way i came up to rectify that is raise the precision, hence the number of cycles the program does, and ultimately computation times up to 20-30ish minutes, and even in those cases it is not guaranteed that the energy remains stable.

I am missing something or triple pendulum is just an evil chaotic bih?

Non-academia Career Options for an MS in physics,1614009049,"Hey guys,

I will be graduating with an MS in physics next year (2022 May). I am not sure if I am cut out for a PhD or academia, so I am exploring non-academic career options. My master's thesis (which I am due to start in May this year) will be in theoretical+computational condensed matter physics, most probably in the areas of quantum magnetism, quantum Hall effect, many-body localization, or random matrix theory. I expect that my project will contain a fair amount of coding work (probably in C++ or Python). In addition, I am taking online courses to learn new programming languages as well as data structures, algorithms, etc.

So far, I have heard that quantitative finance is an area where physicists may find good jobs. I do not have any experience ""developing"" anything per se, so I am not really looking into the software engineering sector as of now.

Could you potentially wall-run if you were wearing two small turbojets?,1614001414,"I hope this fits the sub but recently iv'e been thinking about the practicality of turbojet engine assisted parkour. The idea came about when I was playing a game called Titanfall 2, where players are able to double jump and wall-run thanks to a ""jump kit"" which is literally two rockets fixed to the characters hip:

[A player wall-running in Titanfall.](https://preview.redd.it/qiz4oj9u11j61.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd95e00fb60cf28f330a1b14128780f9b29940f7)

In the image above the jets used are pretty small, in real life the smallest/most powerful turbojets are quite long and also heavy:

The turbojet above is about 12 by 6 inches so it would be pretty awkward to have two hanging from some kind of harness fixed behind you, but not, (I think) completely impractical. The most I was able to figure out was that two would be more than sufficient to at least hold me up. I weigh about 85 kg and each jet can generate 425 N of force (43 kgf). Combined they should be able to support my weight. At this point i'm not sure what else I need to know, I'm no physicist so I wonder if you guys can help me out?  
To reiterate the question....  
Is it practical or even feasible for something like this to work?

The world as a neural network,1613997118,"[https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01540](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01540)

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We discuss a possibility that the entire universe on its most fundamental level is a neural network. We identify two different types of dynamical degrees of freedom: ""trainable"" variables (e.g. bias vector or weight matrix) and ""hidden"" variables (e.g. state vector of neurons). We first consider stochastic evolution of the trainable variables to argue that near equilibrium their dynamics is well approximated by Madelung equations (with free energy representing the phase) and further away from the equilibrium by Hamilton-Jacobi equations (with free energy representing the Hamilton's principal function).  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;This shows that the trainable variables can indeed exhibit classical and quantum behaviors with the state vector of neurons representing the hidden variables. We then study stochastic evolution of the hidden variables by considering *D* non-interacting subsystems with average state vectors, **x**¯1, ..., **x**¯*D* and an overall average state vector **x**¯0.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In the limit when the weight matrix is a permutation matrix, the dynamics of **x**¯*μ* can be described in terms of relativistic strings in an emergent *D*\+1 dimensional Minkowski space-time. If the subsystems are minimally interacting, with interactions described by a metric tensor, then the emergent space-time becomes curved. We argue that the entropy production in such a system is a local function of the metric tensor which should be determined by the symmetries of the Onsager tensor.  
&gt;  
&gt;It turns out that a very simple and highly symmetric Onsager tensor leads to the entropy production described by the Einstein-Hilbert term. This shows that the learning dynamics of a neural network can indeed exhibit approximate behaviors described by both quantum mechanics and general relativity. We also discuss a possibility that the two descriptions are holographic duals of each other.",Physics,SubstantialRange,False,/r/Physics/comments/lpmxil/the_world_as_a_neural_network/

Ho to renormalize the Schroedinger Equation,1613985973,"Following the previous post about renormalization theory, I wanted to share the way I learned about it, which is Lepage's paper ""[How to renormalize the Schroedinger equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-th/9706029)"".

What are some ideas to take STEM research notes efficiently,1613893337,"Hi, I hope this question is appropriate here.

Basically, I am asking about physics note taking techniques that can be used in research.

What I am currently using is Goodnotes on iPad. The reason is, writing equations and drawing diagrams is so much more efficient than typing on latex. But, the data so created is not easily accessible within few clicks and lacks many features. So I was thinking of having another, more concise  version of some of the more complete notes.

Heisenberg's Uncertainity VS Laplace's Demon ?,1613866425,"I'm confused about the general interpretation between determinism and quantum mechanics. 
Over 200 years ago Laplace claimed, that if an entity (he called it the demon) would know the position and impulse of all particles that were created during BBN, this entity could with enough computing power predict the whole future of the cosmos. Of course Heisenberg added correctly, that it is not possible to determine both properties (position and impulse) accurately at the same time (besides Heisenbergs approach there are several different argumentations against Laplace's Determinism). 
But why do we then argue from Heisenbergs Point of View, that the universe at all ist not absolutely deterministic? Just because we (and our technology) are not able to measure both properties at the same time, must we then conclude that a particle could not have a certain position AND a certain impulse at one and the same time? Why do we link the measurement (of course not necessarily in form of a human observer) with the fundamental reality of particles?

I think I have extreme physic abilities but I’m not sure please advise. Here is my story.,1613852695,"The first supernatural event that I can remember Is when I was a boy before I started school.  Before I could talk or understand television I had a dream. I only remembered this dream that I had.  Later in life.  After watching a movie about aliens.  Anyway, I dreamt that I woke up on a steel table, a bright light above my head tools hanging from the ceiling, and purple walls.  I pushed myself off the table stepped onto a squishy floor and started to walk to the doorway.  As soon as I made it in the hallway I was picked up by a strange be being that looked like the alien in the movie I saw.  After that, everything went black and that's it.  But that's the first supernatural experience I can recall.  The next one is a lot different and has nothing to do aliens.
 
I remember again.  Being a young boy just starting out in kindergarten about the age of 4.
 
I remember laying in my bed and pealing stickers off of paper.  I then thought to myself randomly ""i want to fly"" and it was almost like something told me what to do.  I laid down and just kind of let go.  Next thing I know I'm floating around my room little to no control and thinking.  This is so cool. im flying.,  I noticed my body and bed and I thought to myself this is weird and I imagined being in my body again and the next thing you know it was like a thump and I'm in my body again.  I did this several times as a child.  I think that I after projected without being taught by anyone or anything from the physical world.
 
Not long after that I woke up in the middle of the night to a shadowy figure standing beside me. .  It was black had no face and with the silhouette of a man in a trenchcoat and a brimmed hat.  I was paralyzed with fear.  I could not move.  I just close my eyes and asked that it be gone.  And just like that it was gone.  From that day forward I was afraid to ever be in the dark or alone for a long time.  And from that point forward I never flew again.  Side note I never even knew what Astro projection was until after I watched the movie insidious.  When I came to the realization of what I was doing as a child and what possibly the dark figure was it scared the shit put of me. 
 
Let's fast-forward five years from there at 10 years old.  I'm running with my grandparents to Dallas, Texas, looked out the window of the car and I noticed a man that looks just like my father.  My grandparents said it wasn’t him and so I accepted it.  However, in the back of my 10-year-old mind, I thought to myself what if that was my dad just a different version of him almost as if I could come in the idea of other dimensions.  It was like I felt it, Very Strong the possibility of other realities.  At the age of 10 years old, without ever being exposed to it from any television show radio talk or family.  From that point forward I would notice small shifts throughout my life that felt as if it was slightly different.  I just accepted and said I'm weird.
 
Let's fast-forward to about the age of 14.  When I would experience déjà vu.  It was extremely intense and every time I experienced déjà vu It was like I knew that it was some sort of vision from another dimension and it felt as if I have choice to remain in the one I currently or move to another and forget everything from the previous demintion.  At this age.  I also instinctively knew that if I want something bad enough I would get somehow, someway I was going to get what I desired most..  Again, never hearing the law of attraction.  I kept a secret belief to myself that I can make life whatever I wanted so long as I willed it.  But as I progress in teenage years I lost touch with all of this experiences and lived a normal life.  However, at the age of 16 and had a strong pull to the idea that I was meant to do something great.  But I assumed that everyone this age of felt that way at some point.
 
Let's fast-forward to the year 18. my best friend had talked me into going to the church with him every Wednesday and every Sunday. My only interest in going to church, was to meet women.  However, three weeks in and I found myself succumbing to the Christian music, it made me happy.  Filled me with joy.  As I got more involved the church I began to experience the joy more often.  Then one day driving home from church alone .  I had the sexperence that everyone talks about. “When you meet the creator” with excitement I couldn’t wait to go home and tell my mom what had happened.  But as soon as i laid eyes on her.  I dropped to my knees and began to cry. because for the first time in my life.  I saw my mother in a different light.  I could feel all of her pain.  All of her discontents and I realized that she was only living for her children and her husband and that was ever taken from her.  She would be empty and that shattered heart.  All I could do was under the words.  I just want you to feel the way I feel.  Until I couldn't take it anymore and I had to leave, I had to get away from people and pray.  From this point forward in my life.  Amazing things start happening the energy that I produced attracted the most broken people. I would have people that were considered bullies in my school approach me and ask me to hang out even though we had none of the same interest.  I would talk to random people on the street and say things to them that God wanted me to say and they would cry the street and say thank you.  I have thousands of examples of this.  But that's not why I'm posting here.  Now I'm 30 years old.  I have been successful enough to take a leave of absence from work and with all the time off.  I've had my in learning more about myself and this urge to develop this part of me if it exist is growing stronger every day.  That is why I'm taking to this post.  If anyone has any advice on what I should do if I have psychic powers the ability to travel inner dimensions astral project are just clairvoyance.

Can you extinguish a fire by opening the window in -40C/-40F?,1613818385,"Sooo...  There is this argument I'm trying to settle with a friend. The premise  is in the title but there is very little information about it, or at the  very least it's not super specific and clear to a layman.

From  what I've read and understood, in such extreme cold weather conditions,  if a fire starts in a room temperature environment, let's say an apartment building in Yakutsk (where the lowest temp was around -64C and temps regularly go to -38 and above in January) it  is possible to extinguish it by letting the extreme cold weather in, granted it hasn't engulfed the entire building and hasn't come across a  large amount of fuel with extremely low flash points (let's say  automotive gasoline -45C/-43F). So let's say a piece of electronics with the size of a CRT monitor bursts into flames. Sits on a wooden table, carpets all around made of wool (including on the walls), a sofa, books... regular living room. Probably some synthetic materials... Painting this picture because I want to differentiate it from a fire that would start in these conditions but has a large size of fuel with low flash points.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently I'm trying to use the Fourier number to calculate how fast would a 3x3x2.5m////9.8x9.8x8.2ft room cool if you open up 2 windows with total opening of 1.5x2.1m. Also another thing to take into account is that cold air will be really dense, which would mean more oxygen for the fire, but the relative humidity will also be really high (between 40 and 60% according to [this article](https://brownell.co.uk/datasheets/basics_humidity.pdf) however I have a feeling I'm missing something there). There is also the dew point to take into consideration... and while the room and everything in it is cooling, the fire still goes on... which makes it more complicated.

Hopefully  someone will help shed some specifics as I'm fairly confident that the amount of energy to maintain a fire in such conditions will require significant amounts of very specific fuel sources that are usually not contained even in a regular household in Yakutsk... but I also may be wrong and I'd like to know if that is the case.

Also a follow up question... At what negative temperature (granted it's  again a normal household fire that starts in a 3x3x2.5m/9.8x9.8x8.2ft room) would you open the window to help put out/completely put out the  fire? Mind you... In these extreme scenarios firefighters will have issues getting to the point of incident and also will have issues with  their equipment, so you can't really rely on them as much as you would  normally do if it was -10C/14F (and ""rely"" is kind of stretching it).

Mapping the Space of Chemical Reactions Using Deep Learning,1613779555,"Chemical space, a concept in cheminformatics, refers to the property space spanned by all possible chemical compounds and molecules adhering to a given set of construction principles and boundary conditions.

The largest public database of molecules so far is [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and it contains just over 100 million.

Chemists have been moving towards AI as a navigation tool as it is believed that AI can lead chemists to new frontiers. AI can explore chemical space and chemical reaction space much faster than humans. AI can help us find molecules that might otherwise be overlooked and help better understand their transformations.

Mad Dog Theory. (GROUNDBREAKING SCIENCE),1613763053,"So we have fundamental general relativity and fundamental quantum mechanics. These theories both explain a lot but are missing a key element to tie them together. We have string theory which is close. Now with the understanding of Gravitational Wave Background it confirms my theory and here I will explain.
So string theory states that we have some string like filament close in conjecture with two subatomic particles.
This explains the speed of light in a vacuum and tries to tie it with quantum mechanic. The reason it does not work well cause it has an unexplained feature of the particles being in two simultaneous locations at once. This makes about the proposition of multiple universes, etc...
It also makes General relativity unexplainable on a small scale as well as the infinite energy created from quantum mechanics on a large scale.
Here is where my theory helps further this process. 

Mad Dog Theory is: Quantum mechanics explains the ripples from blackholes. String theory are the wormholes connection in blackholes. General Relativity explains what is on the other side of blackholes. Mad Dog Theory is one that states Blackholes are wormholes to other universes. (Visualization: Each blackhole that is created is either a big bang moment on our end or the other end of the blackhole)

To have a concept of time and gravity, it has to be in relation to something. An object in motion will stay in motion.
If we have in this example, a blank universe where nothing existed (pre big bang) if a black hole was created from another universe (which ties in with string theory) we have one reference point. This point with all forces acting upon it evenly in terms of gravity is dense singularity. If the blackhole has nothing to consume to increase in size in the vacuum it must, therefore, be consuming it from a different universe which connects through the blackhole. Our world expanded from the blackhole cause it came from another universe which the blackhole was consuming from. Now the reason why space-time and quantum mechanic works together is that we understand that an object in motion will continue to be in motion.

This is in relation to vibration. The gravitational wave background keeps everything in relative motion, which comes from blackholes... Imagine like a tidepool as you drift in space slowly towards the source of the vibration. So each blackhole that is being created pushes out the universe and at the other end sucks it in (like wormholes). This is why, to this date, our universe is still expanding. It is expanding in the sense of drifting towards the blackhole that is pulling it into another universe or a blackhole pushing things from its universe to ours. Another Big Bang in a different universe...Hawking radiation theory states what happens with our portion of reality but doesn't explain for the latter imaginary version. Hawking radiation theory is a good explanation of how half of the particles that fill a blackhole go to close the blackhole while the other half is pushed out in this one. If the strength of the blackhole was enough to create another universe you can imagine another big bang happening at the other side of the blackhole to create another galaxy, while ours is being pulled slowly towards it. If it is a small blackhole it would be a small galaxy/space. So these virtual tiny particles that are being created are in terms of size of the universe the blackhole is pushing in or taking away. 

These vibration explains quantum mechanics in a large scale and in the small scale with general relativity with infinite speed, time would start to reverse which doesn't seem to make sense. The blackhole is the fastest reference of speed we have as it is faster than the speed of light (since light can not escape a blackhole) and as you go through the blackhole, time is not existent as there is no reference until you get to the other side of the blackhole. Since the reference of the other side of the blackhole will be a new reference point, a new singularity, new big bang, time has essentially reversed.

String theory plays a role in this as it would the be the little string that connects the blackhole together on a large scale. In the subatomic scale the particles are connected by little strings of energy to allow it to almost be at two simultaneous locations but gives way to multiple universes. Same thing on a large scale, blackholes being the largest particles are connected with these strings and give ways to multiple universes since a blackhole in our universe will be the same in another universe...

So that is my Mad Dog Theory and its supporting evidence. For math solutions, it is very simple and has been proposed many years ago. The Reimann hypothesis is a solution to a problem that was never understood. The Reimann hypothesis states that the real part of every nontrivial zero of the Riemann zeta function is 1/2. Thus, if the hypothesis is correct, all the nontrivial zeros lie on the critical line consisting of the complex numbers (1/2) + it, where 't' is a real numbers and 'i' is the imaginary units. This imaginary unit is what is beyond the blackhole. Our numbers can only comprehend the 1/2 of the universe that is visible from what the blackhole puts in, the imaginary unit is the 1/2 that is being put out. It's amazing to think that number theorist were unravelling answers to problems they did not understand at the time.

Thank you for your time and remember to spread the news to physicians and number theorists that can further back this up or try to disprove it. This was way too important not to get out right now.

Boson interactions in Particle Physics,1613759406,"I’m trying to reconcile this idea that bosons are also the field by which they propagate. I could just be completely misinterpreting the standard model.

Let’s take a photon for example. A photon is a particle (in my understanding usually found as a quanta of light) AND a quantum field. This photon field is what propagates the electromagnetic force. They have actual (particle interactions) and virtual interactions. The virtual reaction is a euphemism for just a cloud of photons or a photon field when they are a force carrier. What part of this statement is wrong?

If photons are the force carrier, when two magnets repel is it due to the photons. Feynman diagrams imply this. But... what’s actually happening? Are they exchanging photons? Is the photon field just warping and creating a force similar to the warping of space time?

I’ve looked at Feynman diagrams, watched countless videos and read too many articles. I’m still lost.

Why do Solar Systems form in a disc shape?,1613743851," 

This has been asked before, but I still don't get some points about all this.

From what I've gathered so far, it's something like this:

A molecular cloud with some initial spin starts collapsing due to gravity. Because it collapses it starts spinning faster, following conservation of angular momentum. This eventually creates bigger centripetal forces, thus pressing the mass outwards. Also, up and down / vertical movement cancles itself out, so all movement is horizontal.

I dont't really understand why this explains that the original sphere flattens into a disc, though. Why can't it be multiple disc shaped objects ""stacked"" over each other, creating a cylindric shape, rather than a single flat disc?

Bonus question: Where does the initial spin from the collapsing gas cloud come from?

Maybe you can help me with this question!

I propose a tank of water whatever size is necessary on the ground..; then submerged in the tank in a stationary position there is a turbine sucking in water from the tank and pushing it out, up maybe a 10 foot metal tube then curving down wards.

I'm seeing some talk recently that fusion reactors are making significant improvements. A few questions from a non-scientist:,1613507541,"1. What's the method used to absorb the penetrating gamma radiation produced by fusion reactions?

2. I'm seeing that Lockheed Martin is talking about some rather small reactor sizes - small enough to use in a spacecraft, for example.  Does it seem feasible that in the future fairly small, dispersed fusion reactors might supply electrical power, rather than the current model of having very large power plants providing them and transmitting the power via high voltage lines?  As in, each neighborhood having a relatively small fusion reactor one day?

3. If a fusion reactor could truly be made small enough, if it had the necessary power to weight ratio, you could use it to power aircraft - propellers or jets, either one.   Are the engineers thinking such things are at all in the cards in the semi-near future?  Fuel costs are currently by far the highest cost for most airlines, which is why they tend to buy new planes when the old planes still have a lot of airframe hours left in them; the cost of the new plane is paid for by increased fuel efficiency.  A plane that ran on a ""tank"" of deuterium and tritium that lasted a long, long time would go a long way to drastically reducing the cost of air travel.  It could also revolutionize shipping by sea or rail, although both of those are less intensive in terms of fuel cost per ton-mile.

Does the Earth's water cycle act like a giant refrigerator?,1613432797,"I'm trying to test my understanding of the thermodynamics of the Earth's water cycle. My understanding is that the water cycle is roughly that water evaporates from low elevations and precipitates at high elevations. But when water evaporates, the water body or land it evaporates from should be cooler(due to evaporative cooling). The humid air travels towards mountains. When the humid air rises, water condenses and precipitations happens That liquid water along with arid air travel back to the base of the mountain and the cycle continues. I thought that cycle would lead to net cooling but condensation should do the opposite of evaporative cooling the arid air and water at the top of mountains should heat up as it comes down the mountain as energy is converted from gravitational potential to kinetic, and I believe this should cancel of evaporative cooling at low elevations. But, humid air at high elevations should be cooled by night sky cooling(radiation into space). So because there is a cycle, and hotter air is carried to the upper atmosphere, and night sky cooling happens, the air in this cycle on average should be cooler than if there was no mountain(no water cycle).

Where God Could Be Found in Quantum Mechanics,1613430766,"Hi, I am a new Reddit user trying to post my idea of God within Physics. I am open for some ideas or details to improve the quality of my theory. It is a 6 minute theory, but, it might be worthwhile to check it out. Hope you enjoy it 😉:

This morning, I was perplexed with the question as to ""Who is God?"" 

As the Bible descibres, God is omnipresent and omnipotent being ; a being that somehow is the same person within his son, Jesus and within the Holy Spirit. 

But, yet I wasn't content with this simple meaning so, as a consequence, I started to search for a more insightful view of this godly character, by the means of Science and Physics. 

In sequence, I found a Science news article that explained us about the Quantum Mechanics's World. A world, where Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama (the highest spiritual leader of Tibet), got interested in, confirming and I quote, that ""Religion without Quantum Physics is an incomplete picture of reality"". 

Corfirming to ourselves that he has faith that God could be found in the subject. 

With that being said, let me introduce you to the Quantum Mechanics's world. 

Quantum Mechanics is the fundamental theory in Physics that describes the physical properties of nature at scale of atoms and subatomic particles. 

It describes the beginning of the Universe, as well as its ending, due to a phenomenon called entropy, but let's not deviate our main subject, a possibility of the creation of our ancient universe itself and God's presence in this mysterious begging of times. 

Based on Stephen Hawking's  breakgrounding theory, the Universe began with a singularity that was dense enough to be considered a black hole, since all matter of the whole Universe was contained at that same point in space time. Times where space-time was nowhere to be found, according to Stephen and his fellow man, James Hartle. Then, after this singularity started to inflate, quarks, then protons and neutrons were created in the matter of a billionth of second were created, then, minutes later nuclear fisision ocurred, where as an consequence, hydrogen and helium were substantially created. As matter was created, Physics itself was created and postulated rules which are applied nowadays. Physicians supose that space-time was created at such times and that the Universe is still expanding. 

So, by structuring all these subjects and theories together, you have an expanding Universe that was born through a black hole in which it's matter was distributed by Cosmic Inflation. 

So, after all this Physics class, I am going to propose you a new way of viewing God himself and a different way of viewing his presence in today's complicated universe. 

What if... God is within the Quantum Energy, within the photons and electrons, the two main forms of energy contained at Quantum Mechanics ( by the Electromagnetic Radiation and the Electromagnetic Field respectively) since the beginning of times. (Jesus himself stated that: ""I am the alpha and the omega"". Its definition can be further clarified with the additional phrase, ""I am the beginning and the end"" in Revelation 21:6, 22:13. By saying that powerful statement, he is probably referring the Alpha (the beginning) as the time where this singularity somehow escalated temperature levels or maybe he is referring to times before all of this Cosmic Inflation process, since the Bible tells us that he is the creator of Everything, therefore not just some product of the creation of our Universe. If that is the case, he probably was the singularity himself, containing all this energy that was transformed to quanta in the Cosmic Inflation process.) 

In both cases, God would be expanding throughout Space-Time at about the speed of light (the maximum speed matter could reach according to the General Theory of Relativity, an theory made by Albert Einstein in 1905) since all this energy was propelled by the Big Bang explosion, an expansion still occurring nowadays. 

To provide a further statement comproving my theory, I mention that the same energy contained in God according to my theory, can create matter. Therefore, when Jesus was multiplying bread and fish for the whole hungry Christian community, our Savior was probably converting his quanta to chemical energy. It's really crazy, isn't it? 

Therefore, through this method, Jesus maintained the First Law of Thermodynamics, where he just converted his energy. 

Even if he had created an element without any type of movable energy, he would still have not broken the same law, since E=MC^2 (Energy is mass multiplied by the Speed of Light in vacuum squared). 

Ok, you're maybe asking as to ""How are these particles a being and how do they communicate with each other?"" 

In my opinion, they probably communicate with themselves by the means of quantum entanglement, as long as there isn't an observator to destroy this connection between these photons by forcing a measurement.",Physics,Wanderkoke,False,/r/Physics/comments/lkpuaw/where_god_could_be_found_in_quantum_mechanics/

(question) Pseudoscalar fields / wavefunctions under translation,1613351515,"I'm trying to improve my intuition of pseudoscalar objects, but I'm having a shortage of imagination when it comes to finding concrete examples of non-trivial pseudoscalar wavefunctions. Here's the question:

I understand we can build a pseudoscalar out of a triple product **A** \* (**B** x **C**), since under the transformation (x,y,z) -&gt; (-x, -y, -z) our triple product **A** \* (**B** x **C**) -&gt; -**A** \* (-**B** x -**C**). But can we write down a non-trivial wavefunction that has this property? For example, consider a wavefunction that has a plane wave component shifted by a translation **r0:**

ψ(**r**) \~ exp(i\***k\***(**r** \+ **r0**))

where **r** = (x, y, z). This piece doesn't seem to transform cleanly under parity, since

ψ(-**r**) \~ exp(i\*(-**k)\***(-**r** \+ **r0**)) = exp(i\***k\*r)**exp(-i\***k\*r0**).

A similar thing happens if we have a gaussian wavepacket not centered at the origin; the part of the wavefunction exp(-(x+x0)\^2 / 2σ)\*exp(-(y+y0)\^2 / 2σ)\*exp(-(z+z0)\^2 / 2σ) is not invariant under reflection. So, how can pseudoscalar particles be described properly as wavepackets such that they remain pseudoscalars after a coordinate system translation?

Moving faster than C,1613320861,"To be going faster than C is to be moving backward through time, so the act of moving at superluminal speeds in your space ship would in effect be creating a duplicate of you, so you could turn around at your destination and see yourself originally setting off on your trip.

How can I emit ozone at a near constant rate?,1613318963,"I am doing research for my university where I am trying to make a robot that can detect and find the source of an ozone leak.

If speed of light is direction dependent why isn't half of the night sky brighter than the other ?,1613267519,"I've watched this video recently : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k (`Why The Speed Of Light* Can't Be Measured` on the Veritasium channel).

I think I understand the concept. Speed of light is `C` in all directions by conventions, but the math hold true if it's `C/2` in one direction and infinitely fast in the other. All the math cancels out this perfectly giving the same answer for each questions.

But in this case, the observable universe should be warped in a some what oblong shape (infinitely long if you go to the extreme `C/2` infinitely case) ?
And thus if we can see more of the sky in one dirrection and this part should include more glowy stuff making it brighter.

I guess you could answer this easly by : ""the expending speed of the universe would also vary in fonction of the speed of light canceling the effect perfectly"" but I'm not sure of how that would looks like nor I have bother to learn all the calculations to do to check that.
(my main problem is I could accept different part of space time expending at different rate, but this isn't the same thing, this would be the same part of space expending at different rates depending of the dirrection)

Are you better off turning on the tap and swishing the water around all the time while it is on to ensure even distribution of the newly added hot/cold water, or are you better off letting it pool for a minute before mixing it through?  

Is there even a difference as the same amount of hot or cold water is getting added either way?

Can negative energy be created by making a Helium Isotope that has a lower freezing point than Hydrogen and Helium-4 (what empty space in the universe is made by). The reason why I say this is because there's a study that made negative energy by freezing a molecule (idr which) to one degree above absolute 0, which made a slight space warp effect. If you could do the same thing with helium, since to make a possible jet propulsion you need negative energy, you can freeze something below Helium-4 and Hydrogen, and because freezing is an endothermic reaction, release the particles into the space in front of you, causing less space for the natural particles, causing them to shrink, and if done enough, causes a space warp",Physics,Crazed_Systems,False,/r/Physics/comments/lhouwj/theory_to_make_negative_energy_to_create_a_space/

bad at titles,1613059839,"So to start out I'm not college educated more just interested in physics but I wanted to ask something and hopefully get redirected to something I had no idea existed. So the 5th dimension or the omniverse, holds infinite multiverses right? Do we have a graph for that or no? 

To go a bit back a multiverse is a 4d space which houses all time for an infinite set of 3d universes, right? So if we were to graph out a multiverse on the hypothetical graph we could go to any point on the w axis (the w axis would represent time) and there would theoretically be infinite 3d spaces all with the different outcomes of observations of the quantum realm from that singular point in time that's going concurrently with all observations (or alternate universes ig) of that timeline. Where the +'s and -'s of our math go to exist. 

So if someone were to go back into time they wouldn't just be going to a different universe they would be going to a different set of universes, those universes just being the rest of the equation for the graph so (w, x, y, z).

"I just finished ""The Future of Fusion Energy"" and it is one of the best books I have ever read, what are your favourite physics books?",1613050514,"I was recommended to read [The Future of Fusion Energy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43700662-the-future-of-fusion-energy) by /r/fusion and yeah, it was awesome and probably my favourite book ever, let alone my favourite Physics book. 

I summarised it in my [Goodreads review](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3730238583):

&gt;**TL;DR**: This is probably the best book I have ever read although [An Indispensable Truth: How Fusion Power Can Save the Planet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11249163-an-indispensable-truth) would certainly be a close second. I really cannot recommend it enough. Furthermore, the books is very accessible as there are no mathematical derivations and the science is well explained that I believe it would be understandable to anyone with a high school physics education. I hope it achieves the wide readership it deserves.

&gt;The book explains the current state of the field of fusion energy (along with a whistlestop tour of the history for context), taking time to explain the scientific principles (i.e. basics of plasma physics) and yet also leaving room for ample discussion of the technologies involved (in particular the tokamak is discussed at length with a focus on what we can expect from ITER).

&gt;There are excellent explanations of the current challenges facing the field and yet also why we should feel optimistic - while any single challenge can seem daunting, we only need to solve a few of them to get within the parameter space of a working fusion plant and the chances of all such challenges remaining unsolved across so many disparate fields seems unlikely.

&gt;The books also explores less mainstream fusion technologies such as the Dense Plasma Focus pursued by LPP and various spherical tokamak and magnetised target fusion systems pursued by other private companies and there is even a small chapter exploring the use of fusion energy for interstellar space travel.

&gt;So when will we get fusion power on the grid? Well, to quote the book itself:
&gt;&gt;*The proximity to economically viable fusion power should not be measured in years - it should be measured in dollars.*.

Looking for advice,1613050310,"Hi all

I am a last years master student in theoretical physics from Belgium and I am trying to figure out what I want to do next year. I am really interested and fascinated by (theoretical) physics and math and I want to keep learning. I have good grades and the logical next step seems to pursue a PhD. However I don't feel that I am 'ready' to do my own research. I feel like there is so much out there that I don't know yet and I need/want to learn before tackling research myself.

My experience with my masters thesis in high energy physics has not been the best. I mainly have been performing technical calculations without having the feeling that I really understand what I am working with. I feel that I learn much more from following courses than doing research for my thesis.I don't know if research is something for while I want to keep studying.

Can anyone relate to this? Should I just go for it? Any advice is welcome! Thanks!

Please call me crazy because I doubt this will work I think I just need to hear it,1613013021,"Can negative energy be created by making a Helium Isotope that has a lower freezing point than Hydrogen and Helium-4 (what empty space in the universe is made by). The reason why I say this is because there's a study that made negative energy by freezing a molecule (idr which) to one degree above absolute 0, which made a slight space warp effect. If you could do the same thing with helium, since to make a possible jet propulsion you need negative energy, you can freeze something below Helium-4 and Hydrogen, and because freezing is an endothermic reaction, release the particles into the space in front of you, causing less space for the natural particles, causing them to shrink, and if done enough, causes a space warp",Physics,Crazed_Systems,False,/r/Physics/comments/lhbi4p/please_call_me_crazy_because_i_doubt_this_will/

How many electrons per second an electron beam generator needs to produce in order to obtain 7E-8 kg of positrons with a high energy laser?,1613007996," 

I have read that one way to produce antimatter is pair production through the use of high energy lasers. The process consists in shooting a laser into a cloud of electrons, which produces a series of gamma rays. When these rays collide with each other, they produce pairs of electrons and positrons, the latter of which can be extracted and stored.

Some studies ([https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243532641\_Pair\_production\_in\_counterpropagating\_electron\_and\_laser\_beams](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/243532641_Pair_production_in_counterpropagating_electron_and_laser_beams)) appear to indicate that a single seed electron could produce 30 electrons and 30 positrons, although I assume that higher energies would produce a higher amount of antimatter from a single electron seed.

Considering a *hypothetical* laser producing 1.34E+10 watts per second, I assume that the amount of antimatter produced in one year would be half of the following:

E=mc\^2 m=E/c\^2 = 4.2E+17 / 300,000,000\^2 = 4.7 kg

But an electron beam generator would be needed to produce those electrons against which the photons would collide. How can I calculate how many electrons per second would I need if I want to produce 0.0000000745475 kg of positrons per second?

I would like to know that in order to calculate the power output of the electron beam generator.

Subphoton Theory: I can’t believe what I’ve thought of. I’ve just theorized a new end of the universe. And I’m not even a professional physicist.,1613007819,"I've recently heard of a phenomenon called ""Proton Decay"". The theory states that any protons that aren't sucked into a black hole will eventually decay. However, I've thought about it for a bit, and I came to the conclusion that Protons will not fade away, nor will they all be sucked into a black hole, but instead they explode all at once. To back myself up, here's how I came to the conclusion:

Photons have mass. Yes, this goes against most theories about the photon, but they do have mass. However, this mass is infinitely small, and can be written as 1/ℵ0(1 over the smallest infinity). However, one can say that anything with mass and heat emits light. That makes sense, so photons can in theory emit smaller photons with 1/ℵ1(1 over the 2nd smallest infinity), which can emit smaller photons of 1/ℵ2(1 over the 3rd smallest infinity), continuing on into infinity. I'm calling these smaller photons ""subphotons"". I'm also calling this statement ""Subphoton theory"".

Building off of Subphoton Theory, one would say that a photon trying to escape a Black Hole could emit subphotons in the direction away from the black hole, which would then emit more subphotons until they reach the event horizon and escape. This means one of 2 possibilities:
1. As the photon decreases in velocity, so does the subphoton, meaning that they eventually reach an infinitely small distance from the event horizon before they are all pulled back into the black hole.
2. Hawking Radiation isn't caused by small particles and antiparticles forming to cancel each other out. They are caused by subphoton emissions that manage to reach the event horizon. This also means 1 of 2 things: 1) as the Black hole shrinks, so does its event horizon meaning that the subphotons are able to leave the Black hole quicker and quicker and the Black hole shrinks faster and faster, similar to how Stephen Hawking predicted, or 2) Black holes will die at the end of time the same way everything else does(see final paragraph).
My theory on the end of the world: We can actually assume that not only do Protons die, but all particles will die at the end of time, infinitely many years in the future. Protons will die all at once because of the properties of the largest infinity(∞). If it takes infinitely many years for a particle to radiate away all of its mass, then it takes the same amount of time for it to radiate away 50, 10%, or even 0.0001% of its mass. This because ∞ divided by anything other than itself is always infinity. Because it takes ∞ years for a particle to radiate any amount of its mass, after ∞ years, it radiates away all of its mass at once. 

With a bit of logic, we can calculate when all particles subphotons  If we can assume that infinity minus anything is still infinity, this means that ∞-(1/ℵ1) is still infinity, meaning we can assume that ∞-(1/ℵ1) is when all particles suddenly radiate away all of their mass at once. ∞-(1/ℵ2) is when all the photons produced radiate away all their mass, ∞-(1/ℵ3) is when subphotons radiate away, ∞-(1/ℵ4) is when duosubphotons radiate away, ∞-(1/ℵ4) is when tresubphotons radiate away, and so on until ∞-(1/∞), which is when Omegaphotons, the smallest of the infinitely small particles in the universe, finally radiate away.

Is it possible to do a physics undergrad and go to grad school for engineering?

Fourier Transform of the Yukawa Potential,1612826373,"Hello, everyone. I need your help!

So, recently I started my studies in particle physics and found myself facing this ""problem"". After being able to demonstrate how to derivate the Yukawa Potential from the Klein-Gordon equation, the next step is to find its amplitude. That lead me to a Fourier Transform of the potential, but I'm kind of lost on how to solve this (even though I have some ideas like using polar coordinates, for example).

Now, I would expect this argument to appear in layman texts for introduction to quantum mechanics, but honestly I can not think of any book discussing it.

How practical is research in high-pressure materials?,1612820325,"In slightly more inflammatory language, how useful to everyday life is research in high-pressure phenomena? If you go to the [Wikipedia page for ""high pressure,""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_pressure) the highlights seem to have only theoretical significance, such as materials that may exist in the Earth's core and demonstrations of metallization at the 100 GPa range. They mention that diamonds can be made under high temperature high pressure conditions, but those are widely made by CVD nowadays. Are there other important discoveries of high temperature phenomena that can be translated to a practical use? Maybe some energy material synthesized under &gt; 1GPa pressure that can be used at normal pressures, or some property first demonstrated at extreme pressures that has since been observed at lower pressures, or some form of spectroscopy where you must first put a material under high pressure. Really, any work that meaningfully relates to something at practical temperatures.

I ask as someone checking out condensed matter labs I may join in graduate school; I am thinking about going into industry thereafter. Some of the work I've seen in labs with diamond anvils and the like seems interesting, but I wondered if people think it has any future being relevant to industry at all.

Around how much force would a person need to apply (say on the finger side 3 in ^2 surface area is applied, and the thumb is about 1” x 0.5” pushing opposite) minimum to keep the block in place (not to pick it up or anything, it’s just magically in ones hand in the air :p).

"If matter is an extension of energy, could space be as well?",1612082412,"Huge disclaimer: I am not a physicist nor in any way well versed in physics, more a general fan of the larger concepts, so if any of my assumptions or any of what I'm saying is complete nonsense, feel free to stop reading and tell me why it's nonsensical. I know I'm probably wrong, I just want to know why. That being said...

When a black hole occurs, space is stretched so thin that not even the matter inside that space has room to exist, causing infinite density, but we don't know what is actually happening within that infinitely small infinitely dense space.

Well, my two cents on the subject is that due to the conservation of mass and energy, that mass and energy has to have room to exist *somewhere*. Similar to how energy condenses to become matter, when matter condenses too much it becomes space. This would create a whole new universe contained within that infinitesimal point within which to store that matter. Just as matter stores energy, space stores matter (and energy).

Now, one could argue that there isn't enough matter within a singular black hole to make an entire universe. But is space not relative? If the space of this hypothetical universe was created from this black hole energy (often in the form of matter), its size would only be relative to that energy, staying as large as ours was at any given time in relation to its amount of energy.

It could also hypothetically explain the big bang. All this energy wound up nearly infinitely densely until suddenly it has space within which to expand and, well, bang, as energy does.

Another potential connection I made to support my hypothesis of space being matter and energy, is that space moves around matter. Energy can exist on its own outside of matter, but when energy exists *with* matter, it's what causes matter to move in relation to space. Furthermore, when matter exists with space, it causes space to move in relation to energy (gravity).

To end I will pose a hypothetical. Imagine you are an astronaut falling into a black hole (and you somehow have a magic suit that keeps a black hole from crushing you and killing you). To an observer on the outside (assuming they could somehow see through the event horizon) you would fall slower and slower until it appeared you were not falling at all, as time (as another dimension of space) stretched on infinitely long. From your perspective, though, you would continue falling as if time was going normally, and at some point, you would hit the center. But how is that possible? How can you touch the middle of something that it would take you an infinite amount of time to get to the center of? Well that's exactly it, when you hit that center, you hit the end of time, despite the fact that time has no end, as it is expanding just like the rest of our universe (which I believe is responsible for time's forward progression, but that's another reddit post). When this happens, you have hit the 4th dimensional boundary of our universe, just as you have hit the 3 dimensional boundaries as you enter into this new universe (must be an amazing suit to survive the big bang too, ignoring the fact that you're crushed infinitely small to get there in the first place).",Physics,tom1riddle1,False,/r/Physics/comments/l98cqb/if_matter_is_an_extension_of_energy_could_space/

What kind of computer hardware is best for physics simulations and modeling?,1612054868,"Apologies if this isn't the proper forum, if so let me know a more appropriate forum and I will delete from here. That said, I figured some scientists may know best in this regard.

So some background to my question:  I am currently starting research focused on first principle simulations of atomic and molecular structures and properties (likely using VASP, Quantum Espresso, and Avogadro, among other software). While doing this research I will have access to a high performance computing (HPC) cluster for particularly demanding calculations. However, for smaller simulations,  I thought it may be nice to get my own workstation that can handle the more basic stuff. That way I won't need to constantly request access to the HPC, schedule usage times, take away from the usage time of other researchers, and just generally have an easier time of it myself. 

I have a general idea and some knowledge about what's best (typically more and faster is better), and even a tentative idea for a workstation build. However, there are a few specifics I still have questions about. These are:

1. How important is ECC memory for a personal workstation when applied to atomic and molecular simulations? I know for large servers, HPC clusters, and supercomputers that ECC memory is vital, since there is so much memory being used, but I don't know if that importance translates to 64GB of ram in a personal workstation
2. How important are GPU's? Obviously GPU's can help out with graphical models and simulations, but I've also read that GPU's can be used to take some of the load off of CPU's and can even be more accurate in their calculations. That said, I'm not sure if that's true, if it's done automatically, if it depends on the program you're using, or if it's something you as the user can control. 
3. If GPU's are important, what kind of GPU's are the best? I've read a lot that Nvidia's Quadro GPU's may be the best, because they have double precision, more memory, and support ECC memory (but again, how important is ECC memory? I have no idea). That said, I've also read that the Quadros aren't worth it and I would be better off using an RTX 3090 instead. Also, would using two weaker GPU's in tandem (via SLI) be better than using 1 higher powered GPU (I know that last part is pretty vague, sorry)

So those are the core questions I still have.  And as I said above, with what I currently understand, I have a tentative idea of the core components of what I will hopefully be building in the coming weeks:

AMD Threadripper 3960X 3.8 GHz 24-Core Processor (with room to upgrade to TR 3990X in the future)

64GB of ECC memory (again with room to upgrade)

Calculating the imparted force of a motor driven hammer on a large lever.,1612044245,"So I'm making my own power hammer and I know that the design I'm building will work, but I'd like to get some specific data on what I can expect as far as output forces on my workpieces. It has been rather difficult to find a good computation method for this.

To start with, it might be useful to lay out the general dimensions and stats of the important pieces.

A 3hp 1800 rpm motor, attached to a VFD (for speed control without losing torque) runs a 12 inch wheel with a shaft connected to it. The shaft is bolted on the face 5 inches from center, giving it a 10 inch circular rotation. (basically think of a train wheel) The shaft is approx. 5 feet long. At the opposite end from the wheel, the shaft is connected to the end of a leaf spring (from a car) which is about 7 ft long. This leaf spring has a pivot point at its center, so it acts as a lever. Think teetertotter from a playground. The other end of the leaf spring has a weighted cylinder bolted to it. This is the hammer. It is interchangeable with weights between 30 and 150 lbs.

System operations: Motor turns plate, plate rotates. Shaft moves in a circular motion producing a total of 10 inches of vertical movement. This actions the lever, producing equal vertical movement of the hammer.

My calculations: At a 'strikes per minute' of 30, the hammer moves at a rate of 10 in/s. (to strike the surface the hammer must travel the full rotation of 10 inches twice each time) Given the hammer has a mass of 30 lb it would impart only 2 lb of force. This doesn't make any sense to me. So I must be missing something. Unfortunately, I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong here.

Follow up: Secondarily, I have yet to come across a good way to interpret the force the motor is able to impart via its torque. I know torque has a direct correlation with how much mass you can lift, and how fast, but what about how hard you can drive that mass into/through another object? I think this is why my force calculation is so wonky. I would imagine driving a 30 lb steel cylinder at a rate of 20 in/s would generate a lot more force. It might be moving fairly slow, but its heavy and the motor wont stop exerting force on impact. More specifically, 2 lb of force will not allow me to shape or deform red hot steel.

I don't expect answers to these questions directly, although one can dream. But even a nod in the right direction or pointing out the proper formula, or maybe some data point I'm missing would be a big help. Thanks in advance to all those who read through.

Canonical conjugates and Noether's theorem,1612029330,"Hey everyone. 
I'm new to the community and I'm not sure if this is the kind of discusions you have here but I was wondering about how did nature decide on the canonical conjugates of quantities like momentum and energy. Why did they have to be position and time respectively? The conjugation seems evident from quantum mechanics but I wonder if it is based on some deeper physical laws and if the uncertainty principle is limited to just measurements.

In my understanding, Noether's theorem talks about the conservation laws that stems from the symmetries in physics. If we want our equations to be symmetric with position transformations, a quantity named momentum will get conserved. If i use the idea of conservation like we use the zeroth law of thermodynamics, basically allowing the conservation to stamp different values to the momentum variable, I can now define momentum based on this conservation. The uncertainty principle tells us that to measure momentum precisely, you'd have to allow the position to be anything possible (thereby giving infinite uncertainty). If I, instead, don't allow position to be anything, but within a certain limit of numerical bounds, I would be able to define momentum by certain limits (because conservation would hold within certain limits based on Noether's theorem). I am wondering if it's not just the act of measurement but the numerical stamping of momentum that will get uncertain by allowing bounds in position.

I would love to hear your views on this. Also, just fyi I'm a noob in theortical physics and may very well be missing some major considerations.

Understanding the behavior of styrofoam balls in a Kundt’s tube,1612016891,"If you watch [this video](https://youtu.be/-diSRyXGrf8) at around 1:40 you can see that, in addition to the stripes formed in a Kundt’s tube (which are expected) there is a bigger wall that moves continuously from the left to right. I can be seen in the image below:

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

It is known that the regular lines that are formed in a Kundt’s tube are due to vortices formed between them (air movement).

I was wondering what this bigger wall, that moves from left to right, then disappears and reappears again is due to. Does anyone have any guess as to why this phenomenon occurs? Any educated guesses are welcome.

I was thinking maybe this bigger wall disrupts / blocks air flow or sound movement in the tube and is somehow pushed to the side? Does that make sense? **What is pushing it to the right though?**

Fuel mass fraction for Hohmann transfer to Mars is 0.96?,1612001220,"Hi, I was just doing a few calculations for amusement and was shocked by the result. 

Using the vis-viva equation I calculated that you need to start with velocity 32745 m/s. 

*v^2 = GM( 2/r_e - 1/a)*

where *r_e* is the orbital distance of Earth to Sun, and *a* is the semimajor axis of the Hohmann ellipse, equal to *(Mars orbit+ Earth Orbit)/2*

You're already travelling with the Earth at 29787 m/s, so you need to increase the velocity by 2958 m/s, that is the delta-v.


Then I used Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation assuming a liquid hydrogen/liquid hydrogen rocket with exhaust velocity v_exhaust = 4400 m/s, to calculate how much of a ship's mass needs to be propellant. 

*Delta v = v_exhaust ×( log(1+ m_fuel/m_ship)*

I got the mass fraction 0.96.

Did I make a mistake somewhere? 96% of the ship's mass needs to be propellant if using a standard hydrolox rocket engine?! 

I've not even accounted for the Earth's gravity. If I've not made a mistake, Spacex will need huge fuel tanks for its Mars expedition.

This is not my homework, I'm too old 😅, just playing with numbers and getting shocked by the result.

I calculated again with Tsiolkovsky's Rocket Equation, but now with ion engine (exhaust velocity 30000 m/s) and got mass fraction of 0.104, which is about 10 percent.

"NOT A ""HW POST"" JUST A DOUBT ABOUT Instantaneous acceleration and velocity",1611993654," 

i have understood the definitions of both instantaneous acceleration and velocity. i am also clear about average acceleration and velocity. **Instantaneous acceleration** is the **acceleration** of the object at some instant in time and can be found by taking the derivate of the velocity function.

  but i still have this confusion around instantaneous acceleration, how exactly does instantaneous acceleration affects the velocity.

For eg; lets take this problem.

A particle is in motion and is accelerating. The functional form of the velocity is v(t) = 20t − 5t\^2 m/s.

Find the instantaneous velocity at t = 1, 2, 3, and 5 s.

Find the instantaneous acceleration at t = 1, 2, 3, and 5 s.

Solution

a=dv/dt= 20-10t m/s\^2

v(1 s) = 15 m/s, a(1 s) = 10m/s\^2

v(2 s) = 20 m/s, a(2 s) = 0m/s\^2,

v(3 s) = 15 m/s, a(3 s) = −10m/s\^2,

v(4 s) = 0 m/s, a(4 s) = -20m/s\^2

v(5 s) = −25 m/s, a(5 s) = −30m/s\^2

Now lets see instantaneous acceleration and velocity between 1 to 2 sec

Avg acceleration between 1 to 2 sec would be v2-v1 /t2-t1 = 5m/s\^2.

v(1 s) = 15m/s ,    a(1 s) = 10m/s\^2

v(1.1s) = 15.95m/s,  a(1.1 s) = 9m/s\^2

v(1.2s) = 16.8m/s,   a(1.2 s) = 8m/s\^2

v(1.3s) = 17.55m/s,   a(1.3 s) = 7m/s\^2

v(1.4s) = 18.2m/s    a(1.4 s) = 6m/s\^2

v(1.5s) = 18.75m/s   a(1.5 s) = 5m/s\^2

v(1.6s) = 19.2m/s   a(1.6 s) = 4m/s\^2

v(1.7s) = 19.55m/s   a(1.7 s) = 3m/s\^2

v(1.8s) = 19.8m/s   a(1.8 s) = 2m/s\^2

v(1.9s) = 19.95m/s   a(1.9 s) = 1m/s\^2

v(2 s) = 20m/s     a(2 s) =  0m/s\^2

i just want to know this.

Acceleration is change in velocity right? when acceleration happens at an instant, say v1 might be changing to v2. so the instantaneous change at t=1 is 10m/s\^2 i.e at t=1 there was increase in velocity by 10m/s\^2? why cant wee see that change in the table? i maybe sounding silly or dumb but i dont know what s happening here.i hope you get what i am asking. thank you.  ",Physics,rahulamare,False,/r/Physics/comments/l8h0c0/not_a_hw_post_just_a_doubt_about_instantaneous/

"The Scientific Method, and The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness",1611989772,"Hi,

I'm Saul Celere, a philosopher, who is developing the Physics of Consciousness. I'm currently in lively debate with other thinkers on [r/consciousness](https://www.reddit.com/r/consciousness/). My latest rebuttal also serves as a critique of the modern scientific establishment, and a call for its reform and a return to genuine adherence to the scientific method. It is also a great introduction to the scientific method, and study of the Physics of Consciousness. It will take a bit of reading, but it will be well worth it.

At the end of the essay I've linked an audio essay that proves that all the Energy of our Universe is conscious. And check out the rest of The Principles of Physics of Consciousness essays.

So, first my interlocuter said:

**""I understand your concerns about the establishment. Be that as it may, you are not the only person with a genuine interest in discovering the truth. You do not have to be a university professor to make a submission to an appropriate scientific journal. It is presumptuous to think you've got it all figured out without input from other experts in the field. Take Einstein. He overturned centuries of physics, something far more radicle than what you're trying to do. But because experiment agreed with his theory time and time again, the establishment eventually got on board. What testable predictions does your theory entail?""**

I didn't mean to imply that ""I'm the only person with a genuine interest in discovering the truth."" I just said that I'm a real philosopher, and as such I'm personally, only interested in the truth. That is, that I don't see what my academic credentials have to do with the truth of my theory. And I'm so regularly asked about them, it’s as if the scientific investigation of our Universe is a country and you have to show your papers before you can enter. ( I address testable predictions later in the essay )

Then, they say:

**""For example, though it's not parsimonious, we cannot rule out the possibility that our consciousness emerges out of entirely unconscious fundamental particles. ""**

No, we can not just rule this theory out, but this theory has received more serious scientific attention than any other theory of Consciousness, and for a hundred years it has proven to be a total failure as the basic postulate for a scientific theory of Consciousness. A century of failure like this strongly motivates the serious scientific consideration of alternative theories.

Then:

**“Another plausible possibility, one that I hold to but you do not consider, is that particles do have an element of consciousness, but that this quality is unrelated to their quantum behaviour.”**

This point exemplifies my real problem with the modern scientific establishment, because for anyone who has truly studied and assimilated the scientific method, this is not a plausible theory, it’s a scientifically bad theory, as it contravenes Ockham’s razor, which is a fundamental principle of the scientific method.

You see, Ockham's razor states that we must never “multiply causes”. That is, if some phenomena is logically and sufficiently explained, we shouldn't add any extra and superfluous causes of the phenomena.

For example, we could say that gravity is caused by **i.** by gravitons, or, **ii.** by gravitons and fairies. In the second case, half the gravitational force is supplied by gravitons, and the other half by fairies pulling on the object, and the fairies are too small to ever be experimentally observed.

Now, that’s a ridiculous example, but professional scientists are churning out theories just as bad everyday.

Take this theory you mention, and let's compare it to mine.

**Question:** What are we trying to explain?

**Answer:** How our conscious experience arises within, and/or, out of, our physical existence.

**Question:** In what terms are we trying to explain it in?

**Answer:** Purely scientific terms, strictly by way of the Scientific Method.

**Question:** What is believed to have physical existence according to modern science?

**Answer:** Physical Energy, in all its various forms, contained within the physical dimensions of Spacetime, as technically defined by Albert Einstein in his theory of General Relativity.

Now, since everything posited to have physical existence in our Universe, is either energy or matter, and since all matter is either a particle or a group of bound particles, and all the particles are formed out of, as well as, convertible into, energy, **then, according to modern science all that is yet known to physically exist, is some form of physical energy, within physical Spacetime.**

( More things, and more types of things, and new dimensions, may some day be observed to exist and then described mathematically, but as of yet, according to modern science all that is yet known to physically exist, is some form of physical energy, within Spacetime. )

Another tenet of the scientific method, is that we explain the unknown only in terms of the known. That is, when we are trying to explain some unknown, or not yet understood phenomena, we never attempt to explain it using any other unknown or yet to be understood phenomena.

Let’s apply this tenet to our case. The unknown, or yet to be understood, phenomenon, is Consciousness. The known phenomena are Energy and Spacetime as defined in mathematical physics.

So, we are attempting to explain Consciousness as simply and as parsimoniously as we can, in terms of only Energy and Spacetime.

Then there exist exactly two logical possibilities:

**1.** Energy does not possess any intrinsic Consciousness. In which case, Consciousness either discontinuously switches on in, or around, the physical entities we know to be conscious. Or, Consciousness is some yet to be observed and defined substance, that might exist in dimensions for which there exists literally zero physical evidence.

**Or**

**2.** Energy does possess intrinsic Consciousness.

There exist no other possibilities except to say that Consciousness doesn't exist, which is absurd since any denial of Consciousness is itself a conscious act.

Possibility **1** is being implicitly assumed a priori by the modern scientific establishment. You can check this; go to any university in the world and study physics, or check their official texts, Consciousness does not exist anywhere in physics; all physical phenomena, in physics, have dimensions and units. For example, Energy has the dimensions of Energy, and units known as Joules. There are no dimensions or units of Consciousness in conventional science, and therefore according to physics, Consciousness doesn't exist, or, equivalently Consciousness doesn't figure anywhere at all in our current scientific model of our Universe, in which we are situated and consciously observing.

Currently, physics is the attempt to explain our whole Universe assuming a priori that Consciousness doesn't exist. So, for example, if you ask a professor to define and explain the physics of an electron, Consciousness won't be included anywhere in his explanation.

An electron, for example, is believed to be completely defined by its physical properties, such as mass, charge etc. And, if an object is completely defined by a list of properties, then any property not on that list, is not a property of that object by definition.

This is how modern science is ruling out possibility **2.** a priori without even realising that they’re doing it, because they don't understand the **philosophy** of their own scientific method, because they have only ever studied science and never much philosophy, and the scientific method is a subset of **philosophy,** and is not itself science.

For at least a hundred years science has only considered the first possibility, and has totally failed to build any sensible theory of Consciousness based on it. This century of total theoretical failure, strongly motivates the serious scientific consideration of the second possibility.

And as you have all seen from my audio essays and posts here, postulating the second postulate immediately makes for a simple and logical Physics of Consciousness, as well as, the very first simple and logical interpretation of the experiments of quantum mechanics, as well as a beautifully elegant solution to The hard Problem of Consciousness, and a logical explanation of the fine tuning of our Universe, and soon I will present a theory of A.I., as well as conscious interpretations of Special and General Relativity that make these theories totally intuitive, since, as pointed out by Immanuel Kant, our concepts of space and time cannot be separated from our conscious experiences of them.

My acknowledgement of the Law of Privacy, ( here, again, I was preempted by Immanuel Kant ) along with the principle that similar forms give rise to similar conscious experiences, allow for a logical and consistent way of deducing the conscious experiences of other conscious entities based on our own conscious experiences as scientists, as I have shown in my essay, **“Fish, and the Principles of The Physics of Consciousness”**

In short, I’ve done more for the scientific analysis of Consciousness in six or seven essays than all competing theories combined. And this is because mine, is quite literally, the only **actually scientific** theory of Consciousness that exists; there exists no other simple and logical theory that doesn't violate the scientific method by either invoking dimensions or substances for which there exists no physical evidence, or by multiplying causes like the theory you propose above.

You see, my theory sufficiently explains Consciousness in terms of only known scientific phenomena, namely Energy and Spacetime; we are physical formations of energy and we are conscious. If we postulate that all energy was created possessing intrinsic Consciousness, and that different formations give rise to different conscious experience, and that various evolutionary processes have given rise to more complex forms that experience proportionally more complex conscious experiences, then we have sufficiently and scientifically explained our existence as physical and conscious entities.

And we get the first sensible interpretation of quantum mechanics!!!!!!!!

And it makes sense within the broader context of our physical Universe, since it makes Consciousness a continuous evolutionary spectrum from simple to more complex forms, which maps perfectly onto our understanding of biological evolution.

It also answers the question of the origin of life: The whole Universe is nothing but conscious life, it’s just difficult for humans to recognize Consciousness sufficiently distinct from their own.

This is why the set of things we consider to be conscious is expanding; scientists were once totally sure that plants are devoid of consciousness, and even doubted whether animals apart from humans are conscious. Now, we know they are, and I have shown that the simplest way of interpreting quantum mechanics is by postulating that quantum particles possess some intrinsic Consciousness.

Then your supposedly plausible theory is the scientific equivalent of adding fairies to our explanation of gravity. Since, despite intrinsic Consciousness sufficiently explaining both quantum mechanics and our experience as conscious physical entities, your theory includes a superfluous additional cause of the particle's quantum behaviour.

So now, according to this theory, we have schizophrenic quantum particles that possess both intrinsic Consciousness and intrinsic probabilism. So, some intrinsic probalism explains their quantum behaviour, but they also possess some latent intrinsic Consciousness, that at some point, and somehow, becomes relevant to our conscious experience???

Now, I'm sure theories like this take a lot of intelligence and creativity to come up with, but from a strictly scientific point of view, that is if we strictly adhere to the philosophy of the scientific method, they are plainly, simply and demonstrably bad.

And here’s the part-sad, part-hilarious thing about modern science: the above essay, verbose as it may be, amounts to a logical philosophical proof that the scientific method selects my theory as the simplest and most efficient scientific explanation of Consciousness, but modern scientists are too unfamiliar with the philosophy of their own method to be able to recognise it as such!

This lack of familiarity is the reason for this modern proliferation of bad scientific “theories'', like multiverses and string theory. Where multiverses are an attempt to explain our Universe by positing the existence of an infinity of totally unobserved universes!!! The pinnacle of bad science!!!

And string theory posits the existence of extra dimensions we have no possibility of ever observing, **since exactly all of our measuring equipment exists only within our four spacetime dimensions.**

Imagine samsung trying to peddle a new 16-Dimensional T.V., and it costs a fortune, but when you get it home it's just a regular 2-D flatscreen, so you call them and they tell you “Oh, don't worry, it's just that the extra 14 dimensions are too small to ever be physically detected.”!!! Sophistry!!!

Nothing more than an attempt to fudge the tensor mathematics of general relativity with the more mathematically simpler 4-D spacetime of quantum physics. Mathematically intimidating drivel! Even the canonical textbook on the subject relies on a, yet to be understood, mathematical proof, that all the positive integers added together equal -1/12, to hand-wave away any pesky infinities!!!! Sophistry!!!

**Post Script about Einstein**

When it comes to Special Relativity, Einstein and I have done exactly the same thing, and it's something that Copernicus did long before us both. That is to correctly interpret experiments already carried out by the establishment.

So, Copernicus gave the correct interpretation of the observations of the solar objects, by changing the fundamental postulate from geocentrism to heliocentrism, just like I've changed the fundamental postulate from non-conscious basic Energy, to intrinsically conscious Energy, and the used the new postulate to finally make sense of quantum mechanics.

Similarly, the michelson-morely and Fizeau experiments that Einstein based Special Relativity on, had already been carried out long before Einstein. And the mathematical transformations at the heart of Special Relativity had already been written by Lorentz, which is why they're known as the Lorentz transformations and not the Einstein transformations. And it was also known before Special Relativity, that the Lorentz transformations gave correct predictions for the above experiments. What Einstein did was to give the correct meta-physical interpretation of the experiments and the associated mathematics.

This is exactly analogous with my interpretation of quantum mechanics; the experiments and mathematics have all been extensively carried out, and I have provided the correct interpretation.

And, in my audio essay, I have also provided some simple testable hypotheses to corroborate my theory, where I outline the Bat and Rabbit experiments. And I have others, including one to verify the observer effect that I’ll explain at the appropriate time.

And this theory is at least as revolutionary as Einstein’s relativity theories, indeed it is the theoretical means by which we will finally achieve an intuitive understanding of Einstein’s theories, since time and space can't be understood properly without some understanding of the physical nature of Consciousness. Not too mention, that it proves that our Universe is a very large ball of interconnected physical Consciousness.

Have you ever studied General Relativity? If you have, then you'll know that its conceptual framework involves imagining an individual observer, armed with a clock and a measuring rod, at every point in space. And of course, all the observers are conscious, or else they couldn't possibly make any observations.

So, Einstein showed that the best way to describe the behaviour of the gravitational field of our Universe, is to imagine that at each point of it, there is a conscious observer of the passage of time and the shape of the surrounding space.

Now, our gravitational field is made up of gravitons, that is particles, that according to my theory, possess conscious perception of their surrounding Universe, and like all particles are vibrating, and are therefore, in my theory, equivalent to conscious clocks.

Very interesting how elegantly the two theories coincide like that, no? Almost as if they're both parts of a larger Theory that’s about to subsume them.

My advice to scientists interested in Consciousness would be to drop all theories that violate the scientific method in any way whatsoever. Once you've done that you'll be left with only one, my Theory of Fundamental Consciousness. Then familiarise yourself with The Principles of The Physics of Consciousness, and start applying them to any science you know. There is bounteous low hanging fruit to attach your name to. The younger you are, the higher your chances of success; that's just how these things work.

And my theory was almost put together by the greatest philosophers of the last century; Kant arrived at the Law of Privacy in his work on “the thing in itself”, and both Schopenhauer and Nietzsche both believed there was a basic conscious will within everything in our Universe. Schopenhauer called it simply “Will”, and Nietzsche called it the “Will to power”.

But then, of course, quantum mechanics and Einstein et al., and they were the last scientists who really knew philosophy, hence our modern philosophical dark age and all this sophistry.

And if your theory really is a theory, then explain its principles and how it can be used to explain neurobiology, and to make logical deductions about different conscious states. And does it include the Law of Privacy? And if it doesn't, then where is the objective physical evidence of Consciousness? And how does your theory relate to the nature of spacetime? Like, you have the basic postulate, so why haven't you constructed the theory? Like, please state your theory and how it works as clearly as I have mine.

Here’s the thing, the truest scientific theories aren't the best of a bunch of competing theories, rather, they are the only truly scientific Theory. That's how you know that they're true, as well as why no one will ever make a real theory of Consciousness based on the postulate you suggested above.

Supportive quotes:

The very first quantum physicist, Max Planck said

""I regard Consciousness as fundamental. I regard matter as derivative of Consciousness. We cannot get behind Consciousness. Everything that we talk about, everything that we regard as existing postulates Consciousness""

Erwin Schrodinger who single handedly formulated wave mechanics said

""Consciousness cannot be accounted for in physical terms. For Consciousness is absolutely fundamental. It cannot be accounted for in terms of anything else.""

And, of course, the never wrong Einstein said ""God does not play dice""

perhaps quantum entanglement is not so spooky??,1611937493,"disclaimer: i am a computer scientist and mathematician who admires physics from afar. i dont know so much; please go slowly! 

i just read [this](https://www.quantamagazine.org/tensor-networks-and-entanglement-20150428/) quanta article and was very pleased at how quantum entanglement might give a rational explanation for how a universe that is, in many respects, continuous can actually be composed of many discrete parts. i was impressed at how other previously established phenomena can be derived (using cool math!) as emergent properties of these entangled discrete parts. 

in other places, i have seen quantum entanglement presented as proof that the universe is fundamentally random or 'spooky', that is, beyond the scope of reason.  i find these claims irritating, particularly when coming from scientists, that is, people who make a profession out of using reason to understand nature. i am very convinced of the contrary position, that is, the universe is reasonable (and beautiful!). i have always perceived the success of physics as marvelous evidence for the power of man's rationality and for the mathematical elegance of the universe. from the little i know of modern physics, i think that this perspective is less popular today than it once was.

I have possible improvements on Einstein's Gravity,1611929111,"How's it going, this is my idea and I am very open to any criticisms and rebuttals. I have not met any serious rebuttals yet. First I want to begin with a quick recap on Newton and Einstein's views of gravity. 

Newtown had figured out that a piece of matter's ability to attract other matter to it was proportional to the mass that that piece of matter had gathered as well as the distance between the two pieces of matter. This was very important and useful and this explained why things fell faster the closer they were to earth's surface. It was only by Einstein though that we found out that it was useful to view space as a 4D spacetime continuum or fabric that could be warped in the presence of matter. The litmus test for this was the observable effects of time dilation: a clock that is placed closer to earth will tick faster than a clock that is placed further away from earth. Then gravity could be viewed not as a force under Newton's paradigm but as the natural motion of objects that were simply just following the geodesics that were sometimes warped by the matter that was laying around in space. So we went from viewing gravity not as a force but as the natural motion of objects in a warped spacetime fabric.

What struck me as incredibly interesting was that not only does spacetime warp in the presence of matter, but it also warps (to a greater extent) in the presence of matter that is going at very high velocities. I prefer to think of this as a contraction of time and space around the piece of matter. In the first case, we have an object with a great mass, or equivalently, great energy (by mass-energy equivalence or e = mc\^2), and in the second case, we have an object of great kinetic energy. What if it is just the case that matter has **adapted** to be attracted to sources of energy?

A natural question would be why matter would have developed this adaption and how this would have been possible. The reason why it would be a useful adaption is because **it takes energy to exist**, even for matter, which we think of as ""dead"". If it takes energy to exist, then each piece of matter has to essentially **compete** with other pieces of matter for sources of energy, otherwise, it will not be able to continue to exist. Think of it like this: all of the pieces of matter that were not able to be attracted to a source of energy ultimately did not make it into the present day, and so all of the matter that currently exists are those pieces of matter that were able to be attracted by some energy source. It is also a useful adaption to **attract** other pieces of matter towards yourself because then you can become a larger and larger piece of matter, and in the case of collisions, you have a higher chance of not being completely destroyed or absorbed into some other piece of matter. This explains why we mostly see extremely large spheres in space and a couple of asteroids but they don't tend to last very long (they end up colliding with things because the gravity of other things in the universe is too much for them).

A natural follow up question at this point would be that this model doesn't seem to explain the effects of time dilation that were described by Einstein. I have an idea for this too and I will use earth as an example. Energy is the ability to do work. The earth is **doing work** by pulling us to keep us on it, and earth is also **doing work** to keep the moon orbiting itself. We know that energy is not created or destroyed, but it is conserved. So this energy required to keep us on earth must be being transferred onto us. The closer we are to earth, the more work the earth is doing to keep us on it, and so the more energy we have to continue our existences. In the case of the ticking clock, the clock that is closer to the earth is receiving **more energy** from the earth, and it is using it to **continue its existence** ***faster***.

This model doesn't even explicitly require a concept of time, since time itself is always just benched against some physical process, for example, the earth rotating around its axis (a day), and again, the earth rotating around the sun (a year). In all these cases, time is just a physical process, and so is the ticking of the clock. Physical processes that are occurring within some system occur faster the closer the system is to some source of energy. In the case of the ticking clock, yeah, the source of energy is the earth, because the earth is just a big ball of energy essentially.

So this may sound all fine, but the consequences may not be clear, so I will make one of the cool consequences of this clear. If we can accept that it is possible that matter has actually adapted to continue their existences just as forms of life have, then you can imagine that once earth had some plants on it and some water and all of that, then pieces of matter were continually trying to make better adaptions than other pieces of matter in order to **gain access to and guard access to sources of energy**. Then eventually these adaptions were doing things like processing water, creating a mitochondria or whatever the fuck, eating food, growing legs, and being able to run from predators and catch prey etc etc. It just makes the most sense honestly. So basically this theory explains how life formed on earth. We basically just had to shed this idea that there is some kind of unsurmountable difference between forms of life and forms of matter. We are really just ""matter"" that have made better adaptions to our environment than like a rock has.",Physics,watermilkcannon,False,/r/Physics/comments/l7tb8m/i_have_possible_improvements_on_einsteins_gravity/

Rotational motion question,1611835767,"I've been thinking about this since yesterday but can't seem to fully wrap my head around it:

Picture a conic pendulum in which the weight's string is attached to a spinning vertical axis. Initially, at a low speed, the string and the axis form a small angle. As the axis accelerates, this angle becomes greater and we can see the weight elevate as it moves in circular motion. At some point the speed of the weight makes it so the axis and the string form a 90º angle.

Why does this ""elevation"" (if that's the way to call it) happen?

My best bet until now has been the string's tension, as the weight's speed increases so does tension, compensating it's vertical component that of the gravitational force over the weight and thus ascending, but I'm not sure how that explains the 90º final angle, since tension's vertical component would be 0 by that moment...

Anyway, I hope I've explained myself correctly, English isn't my first language.

Question about the Relativity of Simultaneity,1611829304,"Suppose we have a person inside a box, moving close to the speed of light relative to an outside observer, so the extra term **u / c****^(2)** **\* x** in time dilation is not negligible. And we also have two clocks in the sides of the box which are not synchronized for the outside observer but are synchronized for the inside one. 

1. When observing the box from outside, different parts (with different x values) of the person inside would seem to follow different clocks which are not synchronized. So wouldn't that cause problems as to the integrity of his body for the outside observer? Like his hand moving before his shoulder which could break causality (even if the time difference is very small), etc..  
2. How would the two clocks on the sides synchronize again after the box stopped moving, so that the two observers can agree on what time the clocks show?

The Nernst Equation.

That is, Nernst proportion is = to (R) the gas constant \* (T) absolute temperature in Kelvin. Divided by the result of (z) ion Valence \* (F) faraday's constant. Multiplied by natural logic of \[Ion\]outside the cell/\[Ion\]inside the cell.

based on the ref sheet (for T in Kelvin, R = 8.314 J/K\*mol, and F = 96, 485 C/mol / ln = natural log, base e (\~2.718)) T=4degrees c = 277.15 K. They also didn't give what Ion I am solving for, so I will just say +1.

Paper by Leland Durley,1611789959,"E=DC^2 
I’ve already explained this in other notes, but I’m going to try to explain it with someone who has a smaller physics mind. What you see as the Universe is actually just a lot of little interactions happening all the time. What you see as time is really long to these interactions, and as we study them with technology further they go towards infinity. This means that we can not learn anything more of them. (We will, but in infinite time, as long as the base derivative of our technology is to the same power.) A derivative just means a change in something, it’s like being in a room and then being in the same room, at a different time, and theirs an apple sitting on the sofa. The derivative of those two events is the apple in the exact 3D image that it is. This means that Derivatives go toward time (the last dimension) there are 2 objects in the Universe that we know of Energy (as photons), and According to Albert Einstein in his theories, Mass. this is not true in my opinion. I believe that the opposite of Energy (or the other thing in the Universe) is Density (the ability to absorb Energy) if the last Force that particles can have is gravity towards each other, then this means that particles have to have a certain amount of themselves over a certain “area” but in the 3D world- Volume. 





This means that Density is pronounced at n/£m^3    where n=particles and £=the smallest number in the Universe (or shortest distance) whichever 1st Dimension you believe in. 



This is ability to absorb Energy and does so in a ratio equivalent to its Density multiplied by the speed of the fastest thing in the Universe(Energy)^2 





This means that Light does not go around objects with Density (you still might consider it “mass” as of now) and feel some gravitational affect (according to Einstein) this is false. Just like in Optical Force where light pushes an object, what’s really happening is light is lengthening its wavelength when making contact with that object. If the object is also light, the amount of the 1st light that we talked about wavelength will shorten based on the wavelength of the other light, and the direction at which both Energies were going. 
If it were Density the light would shorten its wavelength, and the Density would feel a pulse of its “energy gained” (as long as it is not the actual most Dense object in the universe (x particles/x Volume). Each particle would be pushed into the other particle and bounced back with Force that is similar to being pushed or pulled (the Physics Hypertextbook.com) if an object is fully dense, of course this can’t happen- so we would expect that nothing would happen, but what if the object that is pushing it is Energy and the energy’s wavelength is the shortest possible distance in the Universe (or the smallest number) Science will never know if the 2 will fly to infinity or fall to 0, but that will never stop us from trying.

Question about pulleys (with a picture),1611771786,"I started going to the gym some time ago and in the gym they got these pulleys some of which are 1:1 pulleys and some 1:2 pulleys. It was interesting to notice that even when you load double the weight on the 1:2 pulley, than what you have on the 1:1 pulley, so that the force the weight creates on the cable is the same on both pulleys, they still feel different, and by different I mean that the 1:2 pulley feels easier somehow.

So my question is that with what physics equation can this difference be explained? Like this might have something to do with the Newton's II law (∑F=am), inertia or work (W=Fs), but that is where my knowledge ends.

I made a picture also to illustrate this issue:

https://preview.redd.it/21h1vh5twwd61.png?width=1015&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01cefea0cb01caae54d84eced42ca7266a261e85

Like the force required to lift the weight by pulling the rope in both setups is the same, but still somehow the setup 1 feels easier to lift. How can this difference be explained by using physics equations? Other explanations are also appropriated because I have hard time pinpointing or articulating the explanation at all. The inertia is my best guess so far, but I have no idea how to articulate the answer even then.

&amp;#x200B;

Like the setup 1 has twice the mass, but it also has half the distance, so in theory using the work equation they should be identical, because

&gt;W = Fs = ams = gms

and so by W(setup1) = W(setup2) because

&gt;g\*2m\*(1/2)s = g\*m\*s

We know that an electron can be a wave or a particle
If we do not measure, it will not exist in either state.

If the electron is in the wave state, it may not affect collision with material as much as if it were in a particle state. 

If we measure the electrons, they become particles and collide with the lattice structure of the metal more, increasing thermal energy.

If we do not measure the electrons, they are a wave state, and decrease thermal energy.

So, the surface of the earth at the equator moves at a speed of roughly 1,000 miles per hour and we are moving around our star at about 67,000 miles per hour.

Our sun and the solar system appear to be moving at an average speed of 448,000 mph through the Milky Way.

Out galaxy is spinning at a speed of about 130 miles per second while traveling through the universe at about 1.3 million miles per hour.

So with the faster we move through space affects the flow of time, giving that at the minimum time, our planet has been moving for the better part of 4.5 billion years, what time is it compared to something outside our galaxy?

Status of Hilbert's sixth problem - The original Question regarding a unified theory of Physics,1611569941,"
David Hilbert was interested in giving a axiomatic foundation to physics much like 
we have a foundation for mathematics today through ZFC + Propositional Logic + First Order Logic. 
And even though so statement are independent of ZFC, we do have a strong foundation for mathematics 
these days.   

If the observable universe is fully describable by mathematics (I purposefully only say 'describable' here as the ontological status of mathematics itself is also a controversial topic), there should be an axiomatic system such that we can derive: 

 * General Relativity 
 * the Quantum Field Theories 

and from there all the emergent theories. 

So the final theory could look like Axioms+Inference Rules for Mathematics + Axioms for Physics 
Of course, nature could also be paraconsistent. We *may* even be able to user a weaker axiomatization than ZFC for physics at some point. 

I am aware that there is an attempt to 
[axiomatize QFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wightman_axioms) 

How relevant is a rigorous formulation of a unified theory of physics in physics departments these days? How much effort is put into axiomatization?

Behaviour of a Fin @ High Knudsen № &amp; its Relevance to the Potentially Misleading Notion of Ærodynamic Forces Being Essentially Transfer of the Momentum of Particles Striking a Surface &amp; Being Deflected,1611540071,"At times I've seen &amp; heard ærodynamics represented by the model of particles impinging against surfaces &amp; being deflected &amp; momentum being transferred by that deflection. I think it's best avoided, though: a simple scenario in which it yields a patently grossly wrong result is _lift of a flat plate_ : according to it, for angle-of-attack __α__  _just_  departing from zero, the rate at which particles would be striking the plate would be proportional to __α__ , _and_  the perpendicular (to its initial direction) defection of a particle would _also_  be proportional to __α__ : so if we let __A__ be the area of the plate, __ρ__ the density of the medium, &amp; __v__ its speed, the lift would be

__2AρV^(2)α^(2)__ ;

&amp; also the drag would be

__2AρV^(2)α^(3)__ .

(The __2__ enters-in because the total deflection of an impinging particle is __2α__ .)

But would this actually be so in a régime of high __Knudsen №__ ? I realise a fin on a missile or aircraft of some kind would not really be of any use atall in such a régime ... but considering it theoretically, &amp; not letting it be a stumbling-block that the force would in practice be miniscule &amp; take a huge time to exert any noticeable effect (say our craft is cruising through a vast tract of this medium totally in the absence of any other force &amp; has 'all the time in the world' to turn), is this the equation that would obtain?

And it's a rather odd equation in that in order to accomodate _negative_  angle of attack - which is perfectly appropriate to the operation of a fin or canard, although it mightwell be extraördinary for a _wing_ - we would have to append a factor of __signumα__  ,  which seems a strange &amp; unnatural thing to do in a physics equation: it's my 'feeling' that the sign ought always to 'take care of' _itself_ .

Actually ... I suppose if we let say that the area presented by the fin to the flow is

__A⎢α⎢__

rather than

__Aα__ ,

which is actually _more_  accurate, then that takes-care of it: the previous formulæ become

__2AρV^(2)⎢α⎢α__ ;

__2AρV^(2)⎢α⎢α^(2)__

for lift &amp; drag respectively.

And _is_  this scenario a suitable one to adduce to demonstrate to falsity of that 'naïve'  'collision/deflection'  model of ærodynamics, or have I missed something? - something to the effect that it _isn't_  really suitable?",Physics,SassyCoburgGoth,False,/r/Physics/comments/l4dboy/behaviour_of_a_fin_high_knudsen_its_relevance_to/

Quantum space geometry,1611446951,"Hi,

\*\*Dear moderator, please don't ban me, if you delete this post I will behave\*\*

NSFW warning, I'm about to explain a shower thought turned theory so advised and curious.

Recently I posted about the Stern Gerlach experiment and went into a rabbit hole about the way it worked (I know way smarter people worked on this and that I actually don't know much to think I'm right or that I hit the mark about anything, just having fun). The experiment was extended in series with different orientations and the results were observed, it's apparent that making a measurement in the x-axis effects properties in the z-axis (see Wikipedia under /[wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach\_experiment#Sequential\_experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stern%E2%80%93Gerlach_experiment#Sequential_experiments)). 

And so I started questioning if the geometry of space is the same at the quantum level, I mean XYZ at right angles and independent sounds primitive, infinite and intertwined sounds better (just because and you can hate me for it \[having fun\]), maybe with the maths it cancels out to what works, and maybe what we observe as 3d is just a classical phenomenon that arises from this. This theory is my brain's desperate attempt to 'explain' the 3rd experiment but obviously, this isn't helpful in any way and I would just like your opinion, because I wonder what a smarter person might think,  and if they would even consider this worth a brain cycle or not.

Well, my question is whether or not the 'sheet' is elastic and if it's not, a thought process I'd like to see discussed is maybe that it's being stretched, AND if it IS being stretched, maybe there is another force like gravity that causes you to increasingly depress the fabric of spacetime the longer you occupy a fixed point in space, like when you jump off a cliff and accelerate towards the center of the earth.

query regarding instantaneous acceleration,1611427349," suppose our instantaneous velocity is 32m/s at t=1 sec we know that this is instantaneous velocity and it changes at every instant i.e at 1.2sec 1.3sec 1.4secs it will be different,it can be zero in between 1-2 sec.

so if the velocity is 32 metres per sec at t=1 sec, the body need not have cover a distance of 32 metres at the next second i.e at t=2 sec s need not be 32mts.

now suppose the acceleration at t=1 sec i.e the instantaneous acceleration at 1 sec is 19m/sec\^2. so how come the objects velocity becomes 51m/s at t=2 secs.

instantaneous acceleration means acceleration of that instant only, the change in velocity at that instant only. it doesnt have its effect on t=2 secs, how does it affect at t=2 secs, how come the velocity is 51m/s at t=2 secs.

Latte Art (creating whirlpools). Calling all physicists!!!,1611389830,"Yo,

I have no background in physics, but I know it’s important for this coffee machine that I just bought and I’m on a hunt for the perfect technique.

If you’re unaware, type in frothing milk for latte art, or the machine I use, Gaggia classic milk frothing, etc and you’ll find some videos of what I’m about to describe.

Basically, a steam wand is positioned in a jug of milk and the two holes in the wand jet out steam to create aeration. The foam created by the steam is then folded into the milk through creating a whirlpool in the jug. It’s this step that I’m struggling with the most. 

My question: what position, depth, and angle would create the best kind of whirlpool? A lot of baristas like to divide the jug into four quadrants and place the wand in one quadrant, tilt the jug and go. But I’m still trying to find the right position for all these variables.

How Long would the length of the day on Jupiter be if it was a solid Planet?,1611387070,"Hi there, 

I am working on a small sci -fi writing project where the premise is that instead of our solar system developing life on Earth, it is Jupiter that takes its place  . 

In its present form, a day on Jupiter lasts under 10 hours, but since for the sake of the story, there needs to be a relatable sentient race, then I would need Jupiter to be somewhat earth-like and at least solid.  

So I am wondering how long approximately would a day on Jupiter be , if in fact it was round. I would think since it would be huge and heavy, that maybe a day would last longer than earth. If this is the case, then the inhabitants would experience much longer days and nights, and thus their physiology would be also different than humans. 

I have already taken into consideration that a year on Jupiter is actually 12 earth years, and this information is instrumental in creating the types of beings that could thrive on such a planet.

In what order should I study (undergrad) Physics?,1611296384,"Hi everyone. I am a first year engineering student, although I really wanted to do Physics (can't change majors here, and don't really have that many optional courses).  I have decided to self study Physics (and math).

I went to some reputed universities' websites and checked their undergrad Physics curriculum. They usually break it down into (roughly) Introductory Mechanics, then Intro. Electrodynamics, Intro QM, and then comes Adv.Mechanics, Adv.Electrodynamics, etc.

Since I am not doing a proper 'course' in Physics, do I need to follow that specific order. I mean, wouldn't it make more sense if I completed the whole of undergrad Mechanics in one go, then moved to Electromagnetism, and so on?

I don't really have much idea, so I'd be really thankful if you guys would give me some suggestions. Thanks!",Physics,aniurbreakingmyheart,False,/r/Physics/comments/l2hqhg/in_what_order_should_i_study_undergrad_physics/

How can they say this with any certainty, since it isn't falsifiable? Hasn't humanity mistakenly described a lot of things as 'random' (weather patterns, illnesses, etc) in the past? I know that there are equations and models that *show* that it's random - is there much critical theory about this?

Terminal velocity through a fluid in relation to its viscosity,1611239197," Hello Reddit!

So I'm doing a little research project on how does temperature affect the viscosity of honey. Obviously, it does, but I wanted to make a little experiment anyway. Due to lack of resources, I can't simply have a device that tells me the viscosity of honey at different temperatures, so I had to come up with another method. What I have thought so far is making an experiment where I throw a small ball through a tube full of honey at varying temperatures to see well, to see results.

How would this work? Well, when dropping the ball on the tube, I'm sure you all know of this, but there are three main forces acting on the sphere. These are the drag force, the buoyant force and obviously, the gravitational force. Since I want to use a small ball (maybe 0.2 mm of radius), which would mean a relatively small Reynolds numbers, I could use Stoke's Law, which says that the drag force is proportional to the viscosity of the fluid, as given by this equation: f = 6πηrv , where f is the drag force and η is viscosity. Meanwhile, if the ball is falling, that must mean that the gravitational force is superior to the buoyant force, therefore the net driving force F must be given by the following equation: 4/3 πr\^3 (ρs − ρf)g, where ps and ps are the densities of the sphere and the fluid respectively.

That means that when F = f, the ball stops accelerating and reaches constant velocity, ergo, terminal velocity (which we shall call vmax for simplicity's sake). Thus, if we equate this, we can get the following equation to determine the viscosity of the fluid η = 2r\^2 (ρs − ρf)g/9vmax.

My problem here is... how da hell do I calculate the terminal velocity without knowing the viscosity? I researched several documents, and this [one](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/am-pdf/10.1063/1.4948314) seemed to have the answer I was seraching for, because instead of using that formula, it used this formula: η = 2r\^2 (ρs − ρf)gT / 9L. But then I read on and it said that T and L were to be counted from the moment that the ball reached terminal velocity. So I'm back to square one. But I continued reading and it said that you can calculate the time that it takes the ball to reach terminal velocity by solving the equation F-f = ma. The solution to said equation is the following: v = vmax (1− e\^(−t / τ) ) where τ = m / 6πηr. Obviously, this led me to confusion, since you still require η to make out anything from all of this. And even if I had that variable, what is that equation supposed to tell me? Can anyone help me out with this equation? Or does anyone know any other way to get terminal velocity, given my circumstances? Would really appreciate if you guys backed up your responses with some sort of ""official""/reliable source, because saying Reddit is the source is a bit... Y'know. Suspicious.

THE DUALITY OF AN INVERTED AND EVERTED REALITY,1611183573,"According to the Wigner's Friend experiment, reality is subjective to the observer:
 https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/12/136684/a-quantum-experiment-suggests-theres-no-such-thing-as-objective-reality/

If reality is subjective, then reality is subjective to my interpretation of my 3D interactive world. For example, one can surmise two interpretations of reality for a Necker Cube. One reality can be viewed as ""normal"" and the other can be viewed as ""inside out"". Both realities exist in superposition, that is until an observer measures (sees) the Necker Cube and determines its reality (subjectively). While subjective,  neither interpretation is wrong. 

An the consequences of alleged experiment, if true, supports this assertion. The 1943 Philadelphia Experiment, among other things, reports of ""inside-out"" re-materialized sailors emerged. Because details of this alleged incident has questionable validity, and because I'm not a physicist or mathematician (MA is Public Policy), I make a leap of faith at this junction. I  hypothesize that because our 3D understanding of reality facilitates the existence of a 3D duality, namely an everted and inverted form of reality, that everted objects exist. In the case of the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, it is not out of the realm of possibility that an everted sailor could have happened. I apologize in advance - I typed this using my phone so it was difficult to explain more eloquently.

"Stuck with this question, HELP",1611162228,"Hi every one,

I'm following a course from the University of California called the science and modelling of climate change. It is all going well, but I have this question which I just can't answer. I have been busy with it almost all day, but I cannot seem to understand it.

Since I'm following this course for more points from within another university, I cannot ask anyone for help.. If anyone can help me I would greatly appreciate it!

The question:

    1. First calculate the rate, in W/m2, of IR energy emission of a blackbody at 287.2 Kelvin (a value that will come up from the MODTRAN model in a couple of minutes).  The value of sigma is 5.67 x 10-8 W / (m2 Kelvin4).  Assume an emissivity of 1.
      
    2. Now raise the temperature by 1˚ C and calculate the change in outgoing IR, in Watts/m2.
    
    3. From question 2, you now have the change in Watts / m2 per 1˚ C. We will now rearrange this number into a ΔT2x climate sensitivity that has useful units of ˚C / (2xCO2) - the increase in temperature (˚C) per doubling of CO2 (2xCO2). Hint: Remember the radiative forcing per doubling (2xCO2) of CO2 is 4 Watts / m2 per doubling. If you're like me, you'll need a pencil and paper, and you'll need to write out what factors could combine to form the units you're trying to build (˚C / (2xCO2)). Once you've figured out a formula for getting ΔT2x from two values in Watts / m2, you might find it helpful to encode/save it into a few cells in a spreadsheet, because you will be using it a few more times later in this quiz. What value do you get for ΔT2x?

Employability in the UK,1611152274,"I'm a second year physics student in the UK. From reading other posts, I realise a physics degree seems to be more valuable in the UK than US, so this post is specifically for people from the UK. I am currently enrolled on an MPhys course, but I have recently been very interested in going into the aerospace industry. For that reason, I have been thinking of switching from an MPhys to a normal BSc in physics and applying for an MSc in aerospace engineering. I am wondering how necessary this would be to do well in an engineering career (specifically aerospace, but I am open to other types of engineering). I'd like to have some form of career in innovation - rather than finance - but a PhD and physics research doesn't really appeal to me anymore. 

I'd also like to know what else I can do to improve my employability in general. I'm planning to try and get good at Python and C++, and possibly look into a summer internship. Are there any specific areas of physics I should try to specialise into in my upcoming years at university (aside from aerospace related ones) that are relevant to today's industry that may improve my employability?

Perpetual Motion Machine Proposal,1611114061,"I have been wondering why perpetual motion machines are impossible or do not work, unless they are ran on renewable energy. 

I wrote in another forum asking is over unity is possible (still wondering that, so chime in if you have an opinion), but I kind of gave up on the idea. I have proposed a set up here that is using Hoffman's apparatus for the electrolysis of water and its H2 and O2 gases are fed into a wheel. The wheel will move due to gas's natural tendency to rise. Once the gases have rose to the top of the machine, this is where combustion will occur. I know combustion has a lot of complications, such as using volatile gases, but say that it works. I know I need an energy source to get the initial combining of gases but its energy output is much greater than what we will have to put in. Any suggestions on the energy source? it could be another battery, but I'm not sure. OK, so say that the combustion works and the water vapor is produced, that will be allowed to rise and condense, which will then be collected and possibly fed back into the Hoffman's apparatus. 

I understand I will need to input energy for the electrolysis and combustion reaction to occur but perhaps I could harness more energy out of it, possibly through the movement of the wheel, or through the combustion. What do you think?

Also, I'm a college student thinking of this in my free time. Do not come at me.

Solids do the same, they are a mass of spinning particles with densities, held together by their gravitational force compared to the forces around it (the Density, or particles). This makes them the individual particles that make up an Gravitational Entity to appear to be wave-like, they “vibrate” when they are studied at the smallest level. This is happening because the spins of each particle is independent and can change based on the derived momentum between the particles and their collisions.

Before I explain my problem, let me say that professor Susskind must be awesome in his own right, but it just doesn't click with me. His teaching style is very constricted. It is as if he is doing the thinking for himself. He is not that articulate. The mathematics he uses is too careless. He misses unit vectors when doing component analysis of vectors.

For a school project, me and my team trying to find a way how we can remove space debris from Earth's orbit. We're currently looking into how we can cancel a spin of a rouge satellite (which we want to capture). 

The ""rouge"" satellite which we want to capture is a CubeSat of 1,33 kg. The dimensions of the CubeSat  are 10cm/10cm/10cm and the CubeSat is spinning twice every second.

We want to know how much rotational force (in Newton) the satellite has. That way, we also know exactly how much friction force we need to create to get the satellite to stop spinning.

After trying to apply some formulas we calculated that our CubeSat has 0,834 Newton of rotational force which we have to cancel. However, we don't know if this is correct.

If anyone can help us by telling us that our answer is correct or incorrect, and what the correct answer should be, that would be awesome!

Any help is highly appreciated!

How to use DFT-based numerical solver in physical processes describing Supercontinuum Generation?,1610916640,"Basically, I want to implement some Split-Step Fourier Method or any other Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based approaches to solve the [(Generalised) Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation). The whole point is to study spectrum-widening processes like Supercontinuum Generation, where you can see the initial spectrum expand 2-3 octaves from the *central frequency* `w0` of the input pulse.

This is just messing with my head. I know that if we express all physical quantities in metric units, the DFT frequencies naturally are in Hz (or radians per second): DFT frequency are basically defined by the relation

`w[k] = 2*pi*k/Tmax`

where `k` is the discretisation index and `Tmax` is the time-window size (for example, a 5 fs pulse might need a window of 10 fs to avoid spurious reflections from grid edges etc., so Tmax = 10 fs).

But the problem I have is in understanding the relation because pulse envelope is orders of magnitude slower than the carrier frequency: `wmax` by definition is then orders of magnitude smaller than the central carrier frequency of the pulse, `w0`. Example:

Let central wavelength be 800 nm =&gt; central frequency w0 = 20 x 10^14 rad/s. But to define this pulse completely in temporal domain, I need a time window from around -5 fs to 5 fs =&gt; Tmax = 10 fs =&gt; wmax = 2*pi/Tmax = 6 x 10^14 rad/s. That means, the highest frequency I can sample (as per Nyquist theorem) is ~ 3 rad/s.

So the highest frequency DFT can model is w0 + wmax/2 = 23 rad/s? What am I supposed to do, if say, I want to model as high as the next octave, at w = 40 rad/s? Adaptively reduce the temporal window? How do I get there, while still using DFT for the numerical solver? But adaptive window poses other problems, as the SCG process usually involves trains of soliton pulses, centered around frequencies 1-2 octave apart.",Physics,attofreak,False,/r/Physics/comments/kzeore/how_to_use_dftbased_numerical_solver_in_physical/

But if I'll work out and my arm muscles become stronger it's possible for me to win the arm wrestling even if my arm is still lighter and has less mass.
How does that work? Is there an extra formula that takes my muscle strength into account? Is it because of my higher percentage of muscle mass? How can I overpower somebody that has much more body mass?

When I searched the internet I read that in biomedicine the static force is the force that a muscle can exert against a firm resistance.

Physicists of Reddit: Could you make planets hospitable by changing their mass?,1610838064,"Changing the mass of a planet, thus changing its orbit of a star.

If I apply this logic to other planets, could we thus add (or take away by mining) mass, consequently changing the planet's orbit and moving it into a more hospitable range of temperatures, helping with the terraforming process.

Is this a myth? Arrow front of center weight,1610811833,"I am having a hard time believing this hypothesis. And am not a physicist by any means. 

In archery, the latest term with arrow builing is F.O.C. which stands for ""front of center"" and refers to the percentage of the arrow's total weight that rests on the front 50% of the arrow, making it front-heavy.

The claim by many is that having more total weight in the front of the arrow will lead to more of a ""whallop"" or better transfer of kinetic energy into the animal/target they are shooting. So if arrow ""A"" and arrow ""B"" were the same overall weight, but arrow ""A"" had 15% more weight on the forend of the arrow than arrow ""B"", arrow ""A"" would have better knockdown power than ""B"" when launched under the exact same circumstances.

My argument is that since both arrows have the same overall weight, and are being launched under the exact same circumstances, the F.O.C. would not improve the depth of penetration or improve the kinetic energy transfer.

Is there any connection between the theory about the beginning of time and Gallileo's Speed Time Distance formula?,1610809224,"Dear reddit, 

I am a layman with no prior knowledge in physics and the world of science and I wanted to gather some thoughts on the below arrangement of the simple speed time equation (Speed = distance/ time). Apologise in advance if any of the below sounds stupid but I am interested to find out how would you all interpret the equation below. 

I noticed that while Speed and Distance are defined by some function of time. The equation also tells us that Time itself is defined by a forever expanding definition of Time (which made up of infinitely decreasing size of the block of distance) 

This discovery is intriguing as, from what I understand, the equation below thus tells us that Time is defined by (and made up of) infinite number of 'building blocks of distance components'

Sorry if this sound stupid but can someone tell me that if this means Gallileo had thought about the relationship between time and space? If so, can we deduce from the formula below that the beginning of time would be something similar to what the Big Bang Theory a small dot (singularity = in the absence of space). 

Also, how does the below equation interaction with the later discovery by Albert Einstein on the relationship between time and space and Big Bang theory?

The speed of light is a lie.,1610798364,"There is no 'speed of light', which is the maximum rate of travel of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum.

Why? Because a perfect vacuum cannot exist.
Why? If it did, light could not travel through it.

Consider this reasoning:

Light is a pulse; a wave. It has a frequency. This implies something changing state, since a frequency is a measurement of speed of change. This implies something exists to propagate the light.

In a perfect vacuum, nothing can exist to impede propagation. This implies nothing exists! (with non-zero mass that is) Thus, we have the contradiction.

All ""proofs"" of the speed of light are experimental in nature. They are not proofs -- they are experiments, with fundamentally flawed conditions: they assume they have a perfect vacuum, whether that be deep space, or something, which is impossible to be proven/confirmed.

"How is emf induced in a conducting loop placed in a time varying magnetic field, non-zero?",1610774135,"Imagine a conducting loop placed in a time varying magnetic field. The direction of the field is assumed to be into the plane The loop encloses some field. Also the there is field outside the loop.  
Let's make this magnetic field vary with respect to time. By Faraday-Maxwell equation, due to the field enclosed by the loop, an emf will be induced along the loop in CW direction, seems obvious.  


Now imagine a infinitesimally small length of  conductor on the circumference of the loop on the right-most side . Any emf induced in this length due to enclosed flux will be in CW. But I can imagine this small length to be the left-most side of another loop, enclosing the flux, just outside the actual loop. Any emf induced due to this outside flux will be also CW direction. But the two emfs appear to be in opposite direction.   


If I were to integrate this effect along the complete loop, it appears to me in theory, there is zero emf induced in the loop.

Wave-particle duality of light,1610766116,"Could the wave-particle duality of light depend on the scale at which a light phenomenon occurs? In either case, it's going to tiny but ""tiny"" can contain many orders of magnitude.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't put my thoughts into formal mathematics so I'll provide a few analogies. I'll provide more rather than less to hopefully make it easier to understand what I amateurishly mean:

&amp;#x200B;

When we look at traffic a highway, it's composed of individual cars. Yet if one car slows down, the one behind it will, a short time later, slow down too. Then the third car behind the second car will, a short time later, slow down and then the fourth, fifth etc. If you zoom out enough above the highway, you can see a kind of ""wave"" propagate through the cars. Is traffic a question of individual, discrete elements (cars) or continuous waves? Both, depending on the scale. At a lower order, traffic is composed of individual ""particles"" yet at a higher order, some traffic phenomena resemble a wave.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the same thing in crowds. You can observe a wave-like movement pattern in the crowd at this concert:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7sevym/you\_can\_see\_the\_speed\_of\_sound\_at\_this\_queens/](https://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/7sevym/you_can_see_the_speed_of_sound_at_this_queens/)

Would you say that people are individual, discrete elements (persons) or continuous waves? Both, depending on whether you're using the term ""people"" to refer to parts or wholes, depending on the scale.

None of the individuals in that video know they're creating a wave-like visual pattern. They're just responding to the sound they hear and the people close to them.

Each person is a particle yet higher order phenomena start to appear and behave like waves. The most obvious example of this being visible at sport matches where the audience will do ""the wave""; It's not dependent on any one person, it's a higher order phenomenon of the whole rather than the parts.

&amp;#x200B;

You can see the same thing in a flight of birds or a school of fish. The flight/school has properties that the individual parts that compose it don't. For example, it can more readily change its shape, lower its density/disperse or increase it/concentrate, disappear and reappear. It could change every single member, one at a time, through death and birth, and the flight/school would keep existing as an observable phenomenon just like a business or regiment can keep existing even if every individual is replaced. It's a higher-order phenomenon which transcends its discrete parts.

&amp;#x200B;

Is sand discrete or continuous? Does it behave more like a solid or liquid? If your test looks at one individual grain of sand, then it'll behave like a discrete solid (particle). In an hourglass, it'll resemble a continuous liquid. Enlarge the scale enough and you'll be able to observe sand waves (dunes). Enlarge the timescale enough and you'll see show sand waves/dunes move, go up and down.

&amp;#x200B;

Thinking of switching to engineering...help?,1610757118," 

Hi guys, I am a 1st year physics undergrad and I've recently discovered I'm not such a big fan of going down the abstract route with my degree. I find physics fascinating but my 1st semester modules felt subpar with online teaching and it feels like a non-stop desk job for the past 4 months. I'm struggling to remember the material because my physics professors put little effort into their recorded lectures, and here I am now studying for exams.

Nevertheless, I've done very good so far, and I'm certain I will do alright in these exams too.

Anyway, I recently, out on a whim, asked my physics department if I can switch to a Mechatronics degree, because I am interested by the field of robotics (as probably most engineers are), and I like the sound of the modules they have.

I got this offer, but due to COVID I would have to start this degree at the beginning of the new academic year. This means I can either suspend my studies until then, or keep going with Physics and then switch. My parents obviously do not like the sound of me doing nothing for 7 months though lol.

Now I'm debating whether it is worth stopping my Physics degree, if perhaps it would be more beneficial to complete it and then get a MSc afterwards. Keep in mind that the engineering school in my university is top 10 in the UK. I'm really here to ask for some advice...

I do enjoy Physics but I want to transition to engineering or computer science down the road anyway to work in tech, and I know this is what a lot of Physics majors do. But I feel like I've been given a really good chance at trying something new and interesting. Is there a point to switch and lose my first year of physics if I can transition later on (although I'm not sure how well this transition works)? Maybe I should just go for it?

Worse yet, it seems that knowing the fundamental rules can even make things unnecessarily confusing! For example, looking at my coffee cup, I can very clearly discern the cup from the table it’s on, from the coffee in it — to me, these are obviously very distinct entities. However from the atomic perspective, it is quite challenging to distinguish these as materially distinct: at that level, it is merely a story of some groups of atoms sticking together slightly more than others. Quite ridiculously, the question of how we can identify these effective everyday descriptions in a principled mathematical way starting from the fundamental microscopic theory is a topic of forefront research!

One practical application of such a mathematical principle would be a rigorous method to describe ecosystems of bacteria in terms of a meaningful notion of separate species. As it stands, it seems unclear whether we should think of species according to genetic similarity (which can vary quite smoothly in bacterial colonies), or according to their ecological niche (or phenotype) — and in some ecosystems, neither choice provides an obvious delineation of separate species. So how do we know when defining “species” is a useful abstraction anyway?

Another nice example of this is that while, on the one hand, we easily know a very useful model that “rabbits like carrots,” on the other hand, we have no idea how to derive it from all our knowledge of biochemistry and neuroscience. These are the gaps that keep our sciences separate.

Somehow, I’ve always found this to be the deepest and most important scientific goal: to understand how to derive our everyday reality starting from fundamental physics. Maybe then we could see the order in our chaotic world? Maybe then we could derive how to be happy..? Ok, that was a bit too cliche — but heck, it would just be awesome! Anyway, next time I’ll talk about why that ain’t gonna happen ;P

Trying to predict the distance of a container of combusting gas,1610733791,"Hi, I am trying to predict the motion of a water jug when methanol vapor combusts like a rocket. My setup is like this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EEpSfQm8Wo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EEpSfQm8Wo), but my water jug is on its side. I thought it would be interesting to relate the volume of methanol to the distance my jug will fly f(v)=d, but I am realizing my thermodynamics are quite rusty!

&amp;#x200B;

I thought the best way to look at this would be energy that way I am not thinking too much about static and kinetic friction.

I know that all of the chemical energy from the reaction has to go to either kinetic energy or thermal. Without measuring temp I am unsure how that energy would split up. Also, the fact that we have a compressed gas leaving a container would also contribute to the work done. If I was to assume the gas behaved ideally I still have the issue of gas leaving a container to a much much larger container (the room).

&amp;#x200B;

My thought process has been along this path: volume-&gt;  mols of methanol-&gt;Energy from the reaction-&gt;solve for kinetic energy-&gt;use kinematics to solve for distance. Work done I think would be the piece I am missing. Any ideas?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not sure if this is the correct place to post but I'm trying to make a doctor see sense by using logic and physics and I'm clueless.,1610673994,"So, in 1987 we were driving a car with rear end steering that ended up hitting black ice, we hit a bollard and I went through the windscreen of the car, the seat belt I had on stopped and dragged me back through.  My face was lacerated, my hips and back were hurting and when we got to the hospital I kept complaining about my hips.

1987 so no MRIs or CT scans so the xray said I was fine but I didn't care about being blind in one eye or half my face lacerated, I just cared about the pain they said I never had as the xray couldn't be wrong 🙄.  Before this I'd had an x Ray as my sister has scoliosis so we all had them and after my spine was a lot straighter.  I've moved and those xrays are now missing and I'm under a new pain management doctor who just doesn't get it as my x rays are fine.  I see an osteopath every other week and have done for 20 years to keep me mobile as he said all the tendons, ligaments, muscles etc moved so quickly, they set badly and an xray wouldn't pick that up. 

Anyway, many years later, I am writing a letter to my pain consultant as he said there is nothing wrong with my hips as the xray was fine so I'm hoping some scientific jargon would help as there are days I can't stand or even function properly because of the pain.

So the techie stuff

We were driving at 70mph (confirmed by the Police as we hit black ice and they did all their measurements and that was the speed give or take) 
Hit a bollard and we stopped instantly
My head went through the windscreen, the seat belt locked as my head went through and I got dragged back onto sitting in the passenger seat
The car weighed 1020 kgs
I weighed 10 stone (140lb)

Im trying to tell this man in a scientific way that I hurt, I can't stand for more than an hour without needing strong pain relief etc.  My osteopath has written a brilliant letter but my 25 year old son asked about Newton, G force or any other scientific calculation I could give him which would dictate the severity of the accident so it isn't me just saying 'look, I went through a windscreen'.

The good thing (?) about the accident is I have 'dancers hips', they are very flexible in certain positions because of how they set but in others, I can't walk.  My lower spine spasms and laying down, muscle relaxants etc don't do anything.  We're in the UK so the use of painkillers isn't as bad as America but being blind in one eye, my neck is at a constant angle to get the best peripheral vision and when lockdown happened and no osteopaths in phase 1, my Doctor had to come out as I couldn't even walk and he gave me a slow dose of Oxycodone which I used to have for cancer (proven never abused it, become reliant on it etc - I just want it for the bad days as they can't tell us when lockdown 3 is going to finish)

If anyone can help me, I'd be eternally grateful.  My son did a calculation but I want to make sure when my letter goes in, it is factual and as good as he is at physics, my future depends on 10 x 5mg oxy condone a month at the maximum so I want to make this a good letter.

Thinking about a career change from Law to Physics,1610665529,"Hi All, this is my first post on reddit. I'm writing this post because as the title suggests I'm currently at a point in my life at the moment where I'm thinking about a career change. I'm currently in my mid 20s and I've already got a law first degree and a masters degree in law. I've also just started law school (on a part-time study basis) too and it's not been too bad so far considering I'm also working full time at the same time. However having interned in a law firm and having a greater understanding of what it takes be in a solicitor in the legal industry I'm seriously having second thoughts about pursuing that career. Currently the only aspect of law which really retains a sustained interest from me is Intellectual Property (IP). However before my education became more focused on being aligned with getting into the legal profession post-sixthform (college for those who read this not from the UK) I had a keen interest in Maths and Science (Physics specifically). I am naturally quite good at those subjects and I found the process of studying/learning the concepts for these subjects to come fairly easily for me (that is to say I didn't necessarily find it a chore to put in the effort to go over topics/content when it came to self study to consolidate knowledge gained from teaching in lessons). Over the past few weeks I have been looking into going taking up a Physics degree whilst also research what my employment prospects would be like with a Physics degree (that is to say what kind of work would be available to me based on the knowledge gained from that particular degree once you've completed it) and I have seen that a Physics degree provides you with loads of options and avenues of employment upon completion. I am at a point now where I am seriously considering dropping out of law school as being a solicitor and working in a predominantly service sector industry working my way up various levels of seniority within a law firm is seemingly becoming more and more unappealing to me with each day (I could make a possible exception for working in a law firm which strictly deals with IP. So with all that out of the way I'm really approaching this subreddit looking for advice as to what my next steps should be. Should I pursue this drastic career change? Can anyone here give me advice as to how they have found the process of studying Maths/Physics to evolve as you go through higher levels of education all the way up to University/Degree-level and possibly beyond? This is a decision I'm giving an incredible amount of thought too given the financial implications, as well as the amount of time I would be committing to investing, involved in taking up Physics to study from degree-level and potentially beyond. I would also like people to here to advise me further on what their employment prospects have looked like once they got to the end of their educational journey of studying physics too. I apologies if this post is not appropriate for this subreddit and should be posted in another more appropriate subreddit and I am happy for people to direct me to where my questions should go.

Need help for physics college,1610583940,"Hey
I am currently attending my first Semester in physics in germany, and I have got a big problem:
I have got 4 different courses: analysis, theoretical physics, chemistry and experimental physics.
Chemistry is Not a Problem at all. It is basically school physics from the Last year with some additions, i dont think this will become a problem for me. Theoretical physics isnt that bad either, mainly because our Prof is very Good and in my opinion, matricies and Taylor, Fourier Series etc arent really that hard (at least for now). Analysis is getting pretty tough, mainly because there is such a huge difference between school and college mathematics (all those proofs etc) but i think i am slowly getting used to this stuff. My big problem is with experimental physics. While i mostly understand everything in the lecture, i have huge problems applying all those formulas while doing the exercise sheets. All Other courses work fine and i can apply the new learned stuff Most of the time, but for some reason, Even though i comprehend the formulas and how they got drived, my EP exercise sheeets often stay blank. Have you got any tips for me how i could improve my skills in experimental physics? Any help and advise would be greatly appreciated!

About the speed of light possibly being different along different directions.,1610567999,"I watched the Veritasium youtube video where he talked about there being no way to determine if the speed of light is the same along different directions. For example it could be 1/2c towards Mars and infinite back towards Earth. But any experiments we conduct would be consistent with the speed being c both ways. 

So I came up with an idea (I'm sure its wrong because its pretty simple and no doubt physicists have already thought of it) Let me know what the issues are with the following idea:

This experiment assumes accuracy is not as issue. The clocks are accurate down to trillionths of a second and the rotation and orbit of earth is not a factor. Its just a theoretical idea. Whether its feasible I don't know.  

Set up a laser and a clock at point A and another laser and clock at point B. Send out a pulse from laser A toward point B and at the same time start the clock at A. When the laser reaches point B start the clock at B. Think of the clocks like stop watches with laps like those on phones. 

After time t1 send out another pulse from A. So clock A will have lap1A = t1. 

When the pulse reaches point B Start a new lap for clock B so that lap1B = tb. 

tb = t1 + however long it took for the second pulse to travel from A to B.  

Say we do this 10 times. 

Clock A will have 10 laps each with time = t1

Clock B will have 10 laps each with some time = tb

Now reverse the process and send pulses from point B to point A using the same timing.

Clock B will have 10 laps each with time = t1

Clock A will have 10 laps each with time ta = t1 + however long it took the pulses to travel from point B to point A.

Compare times ta to times tb. 

If ta = tb then the speed of light is the same in both directions (I would think). We could rotate the experiment by 45 degrees (or any angle we want in any direction we want) and do it again to check other directions as well. If ta = tb for all of the directions then the speed of light should be the same in all directions. 

If ta =/= tb then we know the speed of light is not the same in all directions but that's all we can determine from this experiment. 

So If anyone could point out the flaws here or suggest a better set up I would be very appreciative. Thanks!",Physics,CeaselessPenetration,False,/r/Physics/comments/kwoi3g/about_the_speed_of_light_possibly_being_different/

How would I test my own scientific theories as a non-science person?,1610560737,"Hi all,

The simulation hypothesis meme...,1610560595,"Hi everyone,
Long time reader first time poster in this subreddit. I should preface by saying I'm a geologist not a physicist... 
Gotta say I usually avoid people who talk about this stuff but I just saw that Tedx by George Smoot and it wound me up... 

Anyway, the simulation hypothesis seems to me, and most other scientists to basically be a bit of a meme which has really spiralled out of control... I assume this is because the non STEM people struggle to distinguish between real science and popular mumbo jumbo..
You go onto Facebook and see IFLS and other ridiculous pop-science journalism and you can't be surprised that the average guy now thinks he's in a simulation, but he couldn't tell you why he thinks that...

My question is, do you think physicists like Neil Degrasse Tyson are in the wrong for promoting this kind of stuff? People are gullible and easily convinced. I worry its giving physics a bad name! 

Other popular physicists like Sean Carroll, Carlo Rovelli, David Deutsch and Sabine Hossenfelder make it clear that they don't buy into the simulation idea but their views are not published in pop science... I guess it's not trendy

I also think it hasn't helped the Nobel Laureate George Smoot did that Tedx talk on the simulation theory... Did you guys see that? It was the laziest least convincing bit of nonsense I've ever seen yet it has 3.5 million views! I wonder why he even did that talk, maybe he's losing it a bit, or maybe they paid lots. This stuff sells! 

So, what do you guys think about the simulation meme? I think it's losing popularity recently (realistically for good reason) And why do you think mainstream physicists talk about it? Do you think they should be more careful? 
And to round it off, what do you think about the simulation hypothesis? (I know this has been asked before and I know most think it's crap but hey its nice to talk about crap sometimes)

Need help calculating stuff for the boat I'm building,1610559044,"I'm building a pontoon boat out of barrels and plywood. Here's my barrel dimension:

Possible giant brown star ?,1610544141,"Hey there physicists,

I've had something on my mind for quite a while.

What if, by random chance, you had a star formation in a heavy element rich environment. But so rich that a decent part of it is iron or even heavier.

As i understand, they would form a central core, akin to what we have inside of earth. 

Hydrogen keeps on fusing into helium, helium forms a layer outside of the iron core, incapable of going deeper because of density.

But then at one point, because your helium (or any other fused element heavier) is far from the center, it doesn't reach high enough pressures to fuse further, and you start running out of hydrogen.
At that point, the fusion's outward push should no longer counteract gravity, and the star should collapse and go supernova.

 I'm sure there is a way to tweek the variables so that it wouldn't happen explode and collapse and go dark eventually. 

The way i see it could be theorized:
Ms is mass if the star

MFe is mass if the iron core

Mf Mass of fusable = Ms - MFe (decreasing because of e=mc^2)

rFe is the radius of core

ŕHe is the radius at which pressure is sufficient to fuse helium 



So here is my question: can you find a set of Ms and  MFe so that there exist ŕHe&lt;rFe even after fusion has stopped and there is a thick layer of condensed helium above an iron core.

Frequency dance in Discrete Fourier Transforms,1610533461,"I am trying to implement a numerical solver for a PDE, that uses DFT as one of its steps. It's your standard field propagation in a waveguide under paraxial approximation (with some dispersion and nonlinear operators). The idea is to convert the PDE into frequency domain and then solve it with some ODE-solvers. The frequencies that show up from DFT do have a physical meaning: they are the (scaled) frequencies of the electrical field.

But I am having trouble translating the DFT frequencies into the physical frequencies. The issue is that I cannot get a ""broad spectrum"" because of time duration limitations of the input pulse.

So we know that for a DFT, the maximum frequency is related to time duration of the function as:

    wmax = 2*pi/Tmax

and the maximum possible frequency that can be sampled is `wmax/2` (Nyquist theorem). The problem is, that this `wmax` is very small compared to the frequencies in the spectral domain I want to study. If I take a central wavelength of input pulse at say 900 nm, `wmax` for a pulse duration of `T0 = 40 fs` (time-domain window say `Tmax = 200 fs`) barely goes 1 nm away from this 900 nm spectral component.

d=EC^2 

d=n/Area(or Volume) Meters (m)

Density=the amount of particles with mass in something 
E=a photon with an energy level (wavelength) larger than 0 


Light can push stuff because light is made up of (appears like) mass 
Light feels Gravitational Force of things with mass because light is made up of (appears like) mass 

Light can’t feel a Gravitational Force to itself 

Things made up of particles are not light, because light is made up of mass traveling in any area as fast as possible. Things with mass have as low of an Energy level as possible. 



Mass has vectors in relation to time, (if you take a derivative) 
Light has Energy Levels in relation to time
No change in either over time results in a derivative of 0


Lights acts like mass and mass acts like Light. 



We can find Light’s mass by putting it around things with mass in space and seeing the effects of gravity. 
Knowing the light’s Energy level, the amount of mass, and the distance between them we will gets value in kg. Curved light is made up of 2 “Force” vectors, the Lights apparent momentum (Light can’t actually have momentum) and the amount curved in a unit of time. Subtract the momentum vector from the final apparent vector to find the Gravitational Force. Do this repeatedly and average results given all else stays the same (except the time of the experiment) you will find an equation for mass’ respect to Energy Level 



After this we will be able to make a correlation between  an Energy Level of Light and it’s Apparent Mass (g) multiplied by a constant. If this constant is undiscovered to us, I will call it the “Leland Constant” or for short L over C letters (my name is Leland Durley)

Need help modeling projectile motion for a robot shooting into a goal.,1610491255,"Given a the height of the robot (h\_r), height of the goal (h\_g), initial velocity of the launch (v\_0), and distance between the robot and the goal (d), I need to solve for the initial angle of the launch θ such that the robot makes the goal. Here's what I've come up with so far:

h\_g = h\_r + v\_0 \* sin(θ) \* t - 1/2 \* g \* t\^2

d = v\_0 \* cos(θ) \* t, t = d / (v\_0 \* cos(θ))

so I plugged in the solved t from the second equation into the first to get:

(h\_g - h\_r) / d = tan(θ) - (g \* d) / (2 \* v\_0\^2) \* sec\^2(θ)

in this instance (h\_g - h\_r) / d and (g \* d) / (2 \* v\_0\^2) are constants so lets say that a = (h\_g - h\_r) / d and b = (g \* d) / (2 \* v\_0\^2) , which gives a simpler version of the equation of:

a = tan(θ) - b \* sec\^2(θ)

HELP: could someone explain Quantum Field Theory?,1610491080,"Hello, I am in a bit of a pickle.

Tomorrow, I am going to be giving a 20 minute presentation for my school’s Physics Society.

Could someone explain it in more detail/link to something that explains it good/give suggestions on how to fill 20 minutes of presentation on something I don’t know about?

I realized that no, there was no friction force, but it's impossible to find that out just by Newton's laws, because you run into circular reasoning. It goes like this:  


Does floor exert force on wheel? 

Only if wheel exerts force on floor.

Does wheel exert force on floor?

Only if floor exerts force on wheel.

this line of reasoning is circular, like the wheel.

The only way I know to ""break out"" of this cycle is to realize that because the relative velocity between the ground and the bottom bit of the wheel is zero, no work is being done by friction, so no KE is lost, so velocity (both linear and angular) is unchanged, so there's no force.

"Why observation breaks the interference pattern in double slit, intuitive explanation",1610425087,"Hi everyone,

I happened to come across something related to this topic which made me think of the experiment in a different way. It made a lot of sense so i thought i would share. Forgive if this is commonplace understanding.

So our experiment setup and outcome is known to everyone. An emitter releases a particle which goes into a double slit, interferes with itself  and creates an interference pattern. (particles are found not in 2 lines as we expect, but in several lines)

&amp;#x200B;

[basic setup](https://preview.redd.it/yydedjfotta61.png?width=801&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=00a3d04f6da6ea45201e82ff502473e613407c23)

Here the particle is a probability wave that signifies its chance of being found at that position. When it passes through the slits , there is a 50-50 chance it could be in any slit, and so it becomes 2 probability  waves that then interfere to create a more complicated wave. This gets resolved at the wall.

Now lets place an observer at the slits. What this does is it resolves the wave into a particle at that one slit it passes through. There is not probability wave as we are now certain exactly where the particle is.

&amp;#x200B;

[particle location resolved](https://preview.redd.it/xr3qjxpbuta61.png?width=990&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45e8e511eaf42bec6350f20c4c9eee950f8565d2)

Now that we are done observing the particle, we release it (think of it as the particle moving through a detector). But here we dont have a complicated wave function, its as though the particle was emitted from that slit itself. 

&amp;#x200B;

[particle is treated as if it was emitted from slit](https://preview.redd.it/cvdmvhnluta61.png?width=1095&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff859620bdbd0043da7e1113027bb77af4884395)

The highest probability for this particle to end up is right in front of the slit, and so half the particles end up in front of one slit, while the other half ends up on the other slit. No interference pattern is observed.

"The blob fish, the immense pressure, and the box....",1610417108,"Hi guys, please help me with this, it's been hurting my brain for so long...

So, the blob fish requires pressure to maintain its shape, and somebody discovered this when they brought one to the surface and it became all blob like (i've attached photos below if you're interested). So it got me thinking this about pressure under the ocean:

What would happen to the blob fish, if you captured it and put inside an incredibly structurally sound box, and brought it from the great depths of the ocean all the way to the surface. Would the blob fish maintain it's shape in transit? And collapse once the box opens at the surface? Or would closing the box remove the entire pressure of the ocean and the blob fish would collapse inside the box, whilst its at a great depth? Or would the blob fish collapse gradually as it rises to the surface, inside the box, like it does when its brought up in a net by marine biologists?

To rephrase the question, if you close an incredibly structurally sound box at a great depth in the ocean, what happens to the pressure inside the box. I hope this is the right place to ask this question!

[Physics] What is the maximum momentary G force that a modern airliner's wing can take before it snaps in extreme turbulence?,1610395555," 

Taken from an aviation safety pdf..

Intensity - LIGHT - Vertical acceleration (g) 0.20-0.49 - Derived Gust (fpm) 300 -1,199

Intensity - MODERATE - Vertical acceleration (g) 0.50-0.99 - Derived Gust (fpm) 1,200-2,099

Intensity - SEVERE- Vertical acceleration (g) 0.1-1.99 - Derived Gust (fpm) 2,100-2,999

Intensity - EXTREME - Vertical acceleration (g) &gt;2 - Derived Gust (fpm) &gt;3,000

The g's in this list is additional g's. So ''&gt; 2'' will read as 3 total g, as there is an *additional* g load factor of 2.

The limit turbulence load (the worst theoretical turbulence the plane  would encounter) for modern jets is 90-100 feet per second, or around  6,000 feet per minute. (FAR Continuous turbulence criteria):

&gt;
Uσref is the reference turbulence intensity that varies linearly with altitude from 90 fps (TAS) at sea level to 79 fps (TAS) at 24,000 feet and is then constant at 79 fps (TAS) up to the altitude of 60,000 feet.

 There is a 50% safety margin, so the max  turbulence it will encounter before a wing snaps off is about 150 fps.

What (momentary!) G loads would an airliner experience if it was  cruising and suddenly encountered a patch of 100 fps intensity  turbulence? (The ''worst case'' turbulence?)",Physics,TermSharp,False,/r/Physics/comments/kvasuk/physics_what_is_the_maximum_momentary_g_force/

"Interested in pursuing the physics, where to start?",1610387060,"(Re-post from careerguidance)

Hello! So I figure it’s best to explain a bit about myself.. I am currently 23- about to be 24 years old. I have never attended college due to early financial issues. My gpa in high school dropped considerably after the loss of my mother and my personal battle with grief and mental illness. Even without being able to pursue what I wanted, I still I found a way to implement my love for math and taught myself application development among numerous other technical skills, primarily on the networking side of things. These self taught skills brought me an opportunity to work for a trading company at the Chicago Board Options Exchange in the Volatility Index trading pit. Well anyways, this job was great, probably more opportunity for riches than any other industry I had ever been in. (I’ve tried commercial real estate brokerage, as well as many other financial avenues), but it ended due to COVID. 

Now I sit here in quarantine, pondering my career choices as every 23 year old ought to do, and I am taking my thoughts to reddit for validation. 

I’ve always partaken in reading of physics and philosophy in my spare time, and nothing has fascinated my curiosity more than the concepts of time and the existence of everything(I imagine we all ask ourselves these same questions). I’ve always told myself that I had no chance of learning anything in physics or going to a school; let alone a prestigious university, because of my low GPA in high school and my history with mental illness in my youth. I guess life just hit me and I assumed it was always a chase for large amounts of capital. 

I guess what I’m getting at is.. do I have a chance? Is it too late for me?

What About the Cat?,1610357013,"Hey, redditoids;

I LOVE physics (hail Einstein), and quantum mechanics is clearly one of the finest tools we've ever developed.  But no tool is perfect;  using a hammer where a screwdriver's more appropriate is the most obvious example.  And ALL of our ideas are merely sophisticated tools, largely subunits of the finest tool we've ever collectively developed, language.  Language is so useful and subtle that we barely think of it as a tool, and thus readily misuse and abuse it.  Sometimes we don't even see what it's NOT telling us.

What do I mean?  Schrodinger's cat.  Supposedly neither dead nor alive until someone opens the box to check.  So I repeat the question in the header:  what about the cat?  Have you met a cat?  Ever dealt with one?  Ever seen one sitting at the window, watching you, or maybe the bird behind you?

My point is, whether you want use the term 'observer' or the less woo-woo 'detector', the cat counts.  The cat's aware enough to know if it's perfectly healthy and wondering why it's been stuck in this box, or suddenly feeling ill and wondering what it's done to deserve this.

No, it doesn't have a degree;  no, it doesn't have a lab coat or glasses or a clipboard.  But it knows that it's alive.  The whole wave-function-doesn't-collapse-until-the-observer-checks notion falls down, because the CAT is an OBSERVER.

Help with Interesting Thought Experiment,1610310825,"I was interested in getting feedback from the Reddit community for a recent thought experiment I had. I am hoping that this post qualifies as scientific content since I am using theories that are normally valid in their own domain but seem to have a possibly observable crossover point. The premise of the thought experiment was the following:

If 2 electrons are initially 10 meters apart and are moved 5 meters apart, what is the difference in the gravitational force between them over this distance? Now, if a photon was initially ""bouncing"" between the electrons at 10 meters (with a wavelength of 10 meters) and that same (or a different photon) is now bouncing between the electrons at 5 meters, what is the difference in energy of these two photons? Do these values scale with each other in a predictable fashion, meaning that one can be used to predict the other? If so, what equation could be used to explain this relationship and does it have an observable way to be verified?

I want to add a disclaimer that I don't believe that this is unscientific content, rather it is a fellow scientist working an original thought experiment (I could not find any similar thought experiment online) asking for support with this idea. I believe that even if this thought experiment ultimately proves to be fruitless, the math is at least not too complicated so others may be able to help. I know that some assumptions I am making in this problem ignore extremely complicated physical phenomena (Einstein Field Equations, Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) but I wanted to keep the equation I derived simple to make verification easier.

The work I have done on my own is attached in the following images ([https://imgur.com/a/h0lFEAI](https://imgur.com/a/h0lFEAI)), I apologize for the terrible handwriting but I figured anything I might have done myself may help others with their solution.

Was Popper Right?,1610290663," 

If an idea can't be proven false it's not science, in recent years this steadfast near definition of the field has seen some shakey ground.

I myself, while agreeing with Popper's spirit, am very moved by the argument that the idea is Human-Centric, and assumes all universal truths must for some reason be able to be settled by experiments that can be thought up by biological ape descended beings.

From the internals of a blackhole, to theoretical higher dimensional planes it feels like we do need to leave behind the idea that we should cap our imaginations with what is testable now. What is possible to test even theoretically moves ever onwards. If you told a scientist from centuries past we now peer at the light from distant stars to see what planets surrounding it have in their atmosphere there'd be a dozen questions before he'd even get to ""okay but how does that work?""

So I was mainly wondering if any experimentalist's out there wanted to give their two cents to the other side, other than a slippery slope argument into science becoming just a cult of theories is there a reason to keep Poppers idea close to heart instead of changing to the newer 'Produces more information then you Provide' some of the living giants like to use now?

On the other side, are we already far beyond that point? Earlier example of the math and predictions of the interior of a blackhole, or grand unification of all forces at the planck temperature. or perhaps the fact many proposed Grand Unified Theories and Theories of Everything end up having large parts if not the entire thing remain unfalsifiable.

Finally on that note, do any share in my belief that we should accept math will always outpace engineering. That even if occasionally holding wrong (but by definition probably so) ideas worth changing up the culture since physics has been a bit stuck since Higgs.

Intuitive understanding of gravity bending space-time.,1610284767,"For months I've been on a quest of trying to understand intuitively what bending space-time means. The usual explanations, with space as a trampoline and gravity as a ball bending the trampoline,  never clicked with me. I think I got something here, what do you guys think? :D 

The key concept is easier to grasp if we start from a 1-dimensional space line and ask what does it mean to bend that. As you can see in the following drawing, that is analog to seeing objects in **perspective**. We perceive only a 2d plane, but we understand that there is a 3rd dimension in which things are arranged, which makes the apparent spacing between them in this 2d projection not their actual arrangement in space. 

Mass is bending that 1d line into a second dimension, making it appear as space is contracted in that region, while it is only expanded into another dimension. 

Measuring the equal distance between things **inside a gravitational field** and then seeing them closer from afar is the same as measuring the equal time between events and then seeing them happening faster from afar.

Interesting Question: Inertial Reference Frames and Time Dilation,1610262321,"So I have a question about relativity in terms of reference frames.

Let's say you are in reference frame A which we label as our resting reference frame. You, your, enemy, and your buddy are initially in this reference frame. 

Then, you and your buddy hop in a Millennium Falcon and go 3/4 light speed in +x direction. Once you're going 3/4 light speed, you're in frame B. So time will go slower for you and your buddy in comparison to your enemy who is still in frame A. Then your buddy decides the enemy was right, so he uses the Falcon's escape Pod from The Force Awakens to somehow zip back in the -x direction at 3/4 the speed of light. 

Now for a brief intermission in this star wars story. I'm going to cite Wikipedia, the most trusted source on the internet... ""In physics, the **twin paradox** is a [thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thought_experiment) in [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity) involving identical twins, one of whom makes a journey into space in a high-speed rocket and returns home to find that the twin who remained on Earth has aged more. This result appears puzzling because each twin sees the other twin as moving, and so, according to an incorrect[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#cite_note-2) and naive[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#cite_note-3)[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#cite_note-4) application of [time dilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_dilation) and the [principle of relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_relativity), each should paradoxically find the other to have aged less. However, this scenario can be resolved within the standard framework of special relativity: the travelling twin's trajectory involves two different [inertial frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inertial_frame_of_reference), one for the outbound journey and one for the inbound journey.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox#cite_note-5) Another way of looking at it is by realizing that the travelling twin is undergoing [acceleration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acceleration), which makes him a non-inertial observer. In both views there is no symmetry between the spacetime paths of the twins."" -Wikipedia, Paragraph 1 of ""Twin Paradox"" article.

So, with the twin paradox in mind, in this situation, enemy technically accelerates from the Falcon's point of view, but it doesn't actually undergo acceleration. The Falcon actually accelerated. When leaving on the escape pod, buddy also undergoes acceleration, the same acceleration the Falcon did, but in the -x direction instead. So the big question is, do you, on the Falcon, observe buddy and the enemy going through time at the same rate. The big difference is that your buddy actually underwent acceleration where the enemy technically didn't, just staying in reference frame A. If we will argue that the enemy accelerated from the Falcon's frame of reference, then how do we resolve the twin paradox in what I cited?

Or am I confused... is the reality that the twin paradox is resolved because the deceleration corrects the twins's ages, so that when you come back, time speeds up in their reference frame technically, meaning that it is technically not possible (or not known to be possible) to leave somewhere at a speed and come back a different age (rendering Interstellar very flawed)?",Physics,makeit234,False,/r/Physics/comments/ku9pid/interesting_question_inertial_reference_frames/

Things traveling through time would normally remain completely stationary within 3-dimensional space, but because time and 3-dimensional space are connected through space-time, the warping of space-time by objects with mass (like the Sun or Earth) causes it to be warped in such a way that objects moving in a straight path through the 4th dimension of time will move towards/into that warped area of space time in 3-dimensional space and eventually into that second object (like the Sun or Earth) within 3-dimension space.",Physics,ComprehensiveMartian,False,/r/Physics/comments/ktffb5/do_i_understand_relativity_right/
How much power to freeze water? I have work and need time.,1610149850,"So. I need this answer for a camping trip I'm planning to take, and I'm trying to plan for the absolute worst case scenario.

I will be carrying 18.89kg of water at 20°C in an environment that is -40°C.

We are trying to figure out whether or not his 5 gallon jug of water is at risk of freezing during the night when the motorhome is unpowered.

"When linearizing a data point of an inverse relationship, how does its uncertainty change?",1610102201," 

I have a question regarding data analysis and uncertainties regarding my physics experiment. Essentially, I conducted an experiment to determine the relationship between salt concentration and specific heat capacity. 

I have collected my values and have an inverse relationship. I want to linearise my data points for a better estimate of random and systematic errors since working with a straight line graph is much easier. 

I have a specific heat capacity c of 5340 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹ with uncertainty Δc 320 J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹ so it can be written like this:

**5340 ± 320** J kg⁻¹ K⁻¹.

*c ± Δc*

Since my data seems to have an inverse relationship, in order to linearise, I just have to find the reciprocal of my specific heat capacity which will give me 1/c:

1/(5340) = 1.87 x 10\^-4

1/c = 1.87 x 10\^-4

Suggested resources for computational physics (simulations),1610092929,"I'm beginning to learn more about simulating physical systems with an eye towards engineering applications.

Ultimately, I'd like to implement results via WebGL/WebGPU and visualize them on the web with a nice controls interface (this is irrelevant for the question, but it gives you a sense of my goals).

I want to start simple, but not too simple. I'd like to become more familiar with electrodynamics, so I'm considering an application in that area -- like a motor or an antenna. I could then couple this with heat transfer for a more realistic simulation. It would be neat to build something like that too. But I'd eventually also like to simulate quantum systems and I probably won't be making semiconductors at home anytime soon.

Any physics is fair game however. I have to do some computational fluid dynamics at some point.

Could dark matter be a parallel universe instead?,1610091905,"I know that sounds like bonkers but hear me out.

Driving on a wall (trying to understand),1610055103,"You might have seen [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZOekFFSoWI), or a video like it where drivers and bikers are able to apparently defy gravity by driving around the inside of a vertical cylinder. Intuitively, this makes sense to me; I know that if they were to slow down they would fall back to the ground. But I was trying to explain it to my dad and I realized I didn't really understand the actual physics at play here.

The mental disconnect I'm having is that I can't see where the upwards force is coming from that counteracts the force due to gravity. The best explanation I could come up with is that it's friction. My thought process goes something like this: Kinetic friction ""scales"" relative to normal force, iirc, so the more the drivers accelerate, the greater the normal force, and the greater the friction. But I still have several problems with this.

First of all, the friction I'm talking about here isn't acting vertically, it's acting in the opposite direction of the car's movement, so how could it be counteracting gravity? Second of all, I don't think the drivers are always accelerating, they're often going at a more or less constant velocity, right? If acceleration is 0, the normal force should also be 0 (unless I'm misunderstanding how normal force would be calculated in this context), and the friction should be 0, but that's obviously wrong.

Am I just forgetting some force or law that's in play here? Or am I misunderstanding how these forces/laws interact? Please lmk if you have any insights! :)",Physics,The_Dialog_Box,False,/r/Physics/comments/ksnbhs/driving_on_a_wall_trying_to_understand/

My guess is that the rays emitted from the sun are bent by its own gravity so when viewing the stars their positions are altered. However, when there is an eclipse the suns rays are blocked and the slight bending caused by the sun is therefore nullified.

How does keeping a temperature probe still in an electric kettle affect its temperature readings?,1609955871,"Hello, I have a question regarding a possible error I made in my method for my thermal physics experiment.  For my physics lab report, I decided to measure the Specific Heat Capacity of NaCl at varying concentrations. I simply calculated the Specific Heat Capacity using the time/temperature values for each concentration. There may be an issue with the method that I need to specify in the evaluation of my results.

To carry on the experiment, I heated the different concentrations of NaCl through an electric kettle. I connected a temperature probe to my computer that has a data-logging software, and I was able to squeeze the temperature probe between the lid of the kettle, keeping the metal segment of the probe still at about half the depth of the NaCl concentration for the fixed amount of time that I decided as a control variable for this experiment.   

When I presented my research paper for feedback, my teacher mentioned that to ensure the temperature measured was indeed the temperature of the solution, I was supposed to stir the solution continuously and if I did not do so, I would have to mention it in the evaluation of my experiment and data since the position of the probe in the kettle would seriously affect the temperature reading.

A relation between physics and ancient ontology (Heideggerian),1609940688,"I am a layman, but a semi-serious physics enthusiast, through my intense study of Heidegger and attempts to interpret ancient Indian ontology through Heideggerian phenomenology some interesting relation came up.

Currently 'Standard Model' of physics consist of 30 fundamental particles.
12 Matter, 12 Antimatter, 4 Gauge Boson and 2 Scalar boson. However we can add gravity as curvature of space time as one more, even if it has not been theorised at quantum scale still at large scales it exists, so we can add it.

But also 'space' and 'time' should also be seen as an interaction at quantum scale because they are 'parameters' and hence a definite way in which space and time are modelled (at quantum level) to represent equations.

So total currently physics need '33' parameters to account for everything, whether at quantum level or macroscopic.In ancient Indian text (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad) number of gods mentioned are 33 in numbers!!. 

However one should interpret them in strictly Heideggerian way, as he was (I believe) first thinker in 2500 years to interpret man for the first time as Da-sein i.e 'Human being is a being whose ownmost being is of being-there'. So gods when looking through his system becomes akin to what we may call 'Axioms' in physics.

Heidegger is a radical thinker, I cannot even express in words, he is unlike no other, whether previous or since. After him only I moved onto 'physicist-philosopher-metaphysician' type thinkers like Poincare (his 3 books are the greatest I have ever read) Einstein, David Bohm, Ernst Mach and Heisenberg from 'pure philosophers' like Kant, Hume, Lock, Descartes etc. There I started to appreciate physics more, how it arises through thinkers and Axioms  are build (but still non-technical). Now I have been reading Feynman lectures where he builds thing through axiom (though best would be technical book in style of Poincare).

A bee flying in a car,1609938612,"This is probably obvious and a dumb question but I’ve thought about this occasionally ever since I was a kid and never bothered to look it up. Or I think I did at one point and couldn’t find the answer.

If a bee( or any flying creature) flies outside of a moving car, it needs to fly at the speed of the car to keep up.

If the bee is inside of the moving car, does it need to do that too? Can it just hover without hitting the back of the car? I assume it can because I see bees and flies in the car sometimes and they don’t seem to have any trouble. But why not?

Can anyone explain spacetime to me as if I were a fifth grader?,1609930756,"Hi! I've been trying to wrap my head around the concept of spacetime. So far my (possibly inaccurate) understanding of it is that it's:

- A mathematical 4D model with 3D and time combined
- An understanding of causality as what ""makes"" time
- Something that has to do with mutual agreement/disagreement of order and time between various events 
- A distortion of our understanding of past, present, future, distance and time 

What I am mostly interested in understanding is how spacetime can be understood in regard to our everyday life. Is it applicable to how we experience objective reality? Or does it only ""seem"" to occur in high velocity?

Measuring if the speed of light is the same in all directions,1609926699,"So I just watched a video from Veritasium about the fact that the speed of light has never been measured on a one-way trip. And that this cannot be proven because you can't measure this, and that this leaves the possibility that the speed of light might not be the same in all directions. 

So I was thinking. What if you do the same experiment with the two-way trip measurement. But phase reverse the signal at the reflection point and return the light signal at exactly 180 degrees. If the speed of light is the same in both directions, the signal should cancel each other out, if not, they are not completely out of phase, and thus the travel speed divers.

AP Physics Work Question,1609886595,"Hi, all. This is an AP Physics 1 question giving me some trouble:

A conveyor belt ramp of length 7m is inclined at 20° with respect to the horizontal and is used to move objects from one location to another location. When an object is placed on the conveyor belt, the object travels up the incline with a constant speed of 1.5m/s . A motor is used to keep the conveyor belt moving. The mass of the objects that are placed on the conveyor belt are varied.

Suppose the motor breaks and a person must push an object of mass 30kg from the bottom of the incline to the top of the incline. The person can exert a force of 150N on the object parallel to the incline. What is the approximate amount of work that the person does on the object to move it to the top of the incline? Assume that all frictional forces are negligible.

I originally thought it was simply W=Fd, and did 150 Newtons times 7 meters. This gave me 1050 Joules.

Then I thought it was W = Fdsin(theta), because friction force is negligible, vertical length of the incline rather than the length of the angled portion of the incline when substituting a value for the distance that the force from the person applied. This gave me 359 Joules.

Finally, I thought that the work done has to equal the change in GPE of the block, which is 718 Joules.

None of these are the answer according to the answer key, which says the answer is 239 Joules.

What Physics program/classes should I look for?,1609832966,"I'm currently an elementary school teacher in NYC. I'm pretty unsure what I want my career to be, but it's not full-time teaching.

&amp;#x200B;

Graduated in 2018 from a top 10 undergrad school with a 2.7 GPA. Didn't go to class for various personal reasons that (I hope) are behind me.

&amp;#x200B;

I was not a physics major, but have always been interested in physics. Took Honors Mechanics and Honors E&amp;M. Taking honors was a big mistake. Didn't go to class and didn't get it. Failed E&amp;M, then retook at the regular level and got an A.

&amp;#x200B;

If I'm interested in learning more physics, and possibly a career in physics, what should my next step be? I have a lot of time on my hands, but can only be present for live classes in the evening or summer.

&amp;#x200B;

What I think my options are:

A. Visiting student at a college offering online, recorded undergrad classes, or summer classes in NYC. Also don't know if I should be looking at competitive schools, or schools near me.

B. Find a community college with evening classes. I don't think community colleges really offer physics, they seem more like ""home economics"" and ""Excel"" classes

C. Free online courses like MIT OCW. Don't get a transcript record that I might show in future admissions. Don't get consistent schedule of a class.

Could someone help debunk my theory?,1609800155,"I have been trying to understand Quantum mechanics more (on my own time), and one of the best ways I learn is by gathering a small amount of information on a subject, forming my own theories and debunking them through research which leads me towards the correct solution, or at least helps me understand why things work the way they do. 

I've been trying to look at the double slit experiment from a different perspective. I'm having trouble accepting (at the moment) that the light travels through both slits. **Could it be possible that the light only travels through a single slit in a somewhat deterministic path?** My reasoning is this.. first it's not just light that this works on. [This article](https://medium.com/the-physics-arxiv-blog/physicists-smash-record-for-wave-particle-duality-462c39db8e7b) says that they observed this with a molecule with 5000 protons, 5000 neutrons and 5000 electrons. It makes more sense to me that this is a phenomenon that occurs with small objects and declines the larger the object is. So my theory backing up the above is where photons (or anything really) interacts with itself as it travels through space. I don't know enough about relativity to be able to say this with confidence but I would like to think gravity is responsible for this and bends the path of itself. So basically, light is emitted on a given path and distorts space-time traveling outwards as it moves through space. **Side note:** That leads me to another theory I have saying how the space warping actually forces objects to move at the speed of light by having it's own interaction warp the path from one ""position"" to the next. That is for another discussion though. **Anyways,** up to this point, light has been traveling on the same path uninterrupted until it approaches the slit. My thought is either that the space warping from the medium would cancel out? Again I don't know enough about relativity, but essentially the distortion wouldn't pass through the medium but would pass through the slit. This would cause the wave like interaction by the object interacting with it's own gravity essentially. After the initial warp right past the slit, the object continues moving on its ""new"" path post slit.

Could this be plausible and if not could you tell me why? I may have not conveyed my idea that well so I can elaborate if needed.",Physics,NullExpectations,False,/r/Physics/comments/kqjzbq/could_someone_help_debunk_my_theory/
[Theory] Passage of time...,1609799065,"Hello

I would like to throw a theory I had and see if its a stupid one.

 Is it possible that the passage of time is inversely proportional to the Higgs field  density? The faster you go the Higgs field becomes more dense around you until you go at the speed of light when you basically become like something like encased in ice but in a solid Higgs field.

Interestingly that means that going faster than light doesn't make you go back in time since the Higgs field density cannot fall below zero. 

Also considering that everything moves i.e. rotation of earth, rotation of earth around the sun, rotation of the solar system around the galaxy etc., then there should be a direction, where accelerating, will cancel out all these speeds, so the spacecraft would experience time moving faster, until a point where the Higgs field density becomes zero. That could provide a way to have a standard in regards to the passage of time. Also the direction would probably point towards the center of the universe.

Should I drop my current elective(in which I am Interested in) and take the one where I can score easily?,1609775636,"So, I am kind of stuck in a situation. I am a 4th year student in integrated BS-MS programme at IISER Mohali.

It's my final semester of coursework and after that I start my summer project and then MS thesis. So I only have around 1.5 years left of my course. 

I am taking the following electives:

1. Physics of Fluids

2. Modelling complex systems

3. Math Methods

4. Principles of Economics

I have heard that Physics of fluids is considered to be one of the toughest courses at my institute. People have been discouraging me from taking that course. Some said ""it requires a lot of effort"" or ""seniors said that its the hardest course here"" or ""the instructor is a task master"" 

From my history, If I am not interested in the course then I don't get any kind of motivation to study it. I took Quantum Computation course once and I sucked at it. I wasn't even interested in it in the first place but took it because people said ""it's easy compared to the others"". Studying it required a lot of effort for me. I couldn't visualise anything and my intuition was wrong everytime. 

I have always wanted to study turbulence and its connection to other fields such as chaos/complex systems etc. Now is the time I am getting it but because of fear induced by others in me I am having double thoughts about my decision of taking it.

Tbh, the moment I saw on the website that a course on fluids is being offered I immediately picked it up. 

This fluids elective is offered only once in 2 years and I only have around 1 year left at my Institute.

I can drop this fluids elective and take something easy from other departments such as Earth/Atmospheric sciences or science education but I don't know if I'll be happy with those choices.

Misunderstanding uncertainty in the Einstein quote “Does that mean the Moon is not there when I am not looking at it?”,1609678427,"I guess he just means ""something can be certain with no observers"". We don't need to look at the moon to know it's there. Things exist and happen regardless of whether we measure them.

I guess I don't understand where in his analogy the *uncertainty* lies.

Does he mean that uncertainty resets? So every time he looks away the moon doesn't exist, then he looks and it does, then he turns away and it doesn't etc. 

Or is the uncertainty initial and one off? So having looked once and seen the moon, it's always going to be there now.

I guess that comes down to 'if he looks away and back, can there ever be no moon' ? Can something regress to being uncertain once it's been made certain?

My other misunderstanding is, how do you 'look away from the moon' in the first place? That is, how do you unmeasure something? How does something become uncertain?

"Hubble expantion rate EXACTLY equal to 1/UniverseLife, COINCIDENCE?",1609666518,"I'm a machine learning engineer, when I see data, I call it what it is. I arrived at this when doing some calculation involving quantum information + cosmology and I find it very profound. Lets dig into it:

[Hubble exp. rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law) (**H**) = 7.38 \[(km/s)/Mpc\].   
\- Long story short, when we turn \[(km/s)/Mpc\] in SI \[m/s\*m\], then substract the \[m\] since wtf would we keep it there in the first place, and H in SI units becomes 7.38 \* 1000\[m/km\] / 3.08E+22  or **2.4E-18 \[1/s\]**  
\- This is something that is \[1/time\], lets turn it into time, or 1/2.4E-18 = **4.17E+17 \[seconds\]**  
\- The Universe life (**UL**) in years is 1.38E+10 \[years\] or **4.35E+17 \[seconds\]**. 

**Coincidence**?  
\- Now accoring to what I found about this, I saw some wrong calculations of what is called [Hubble time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law#Hubble_time),   
\- and a [Quora post](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-value-of-Hubbles-constant-in-meters-per-second-squared), where someone asked for H in SI units, and couldn't not see what I explained above, but the consensus was that it was some coinckidy, and we happend to live in the exact time when this relation is true, in the past it was not, and in the future it will not be true, and didn't dive further  
\- but when you look at the numbers (**1/H =** **4.17E+17 \[seconds\] and UL = 4.35E+17 \[seconds\]**[\+/- error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe)**),** you will confirm that the Hubble constant as time is exactly within that error.  
\- Now you don't have to be ML engineer or physisits to see that the probability of that beeing a coincidence is next to 0  
\- If there are 10k constants in physics (which is way off), **the prob.** of two of them being the same in the range of \*10\^17 **is about 1/100000000000000**

**So let's dive further**, let's assume that Hubble exp. rate was ALWAYS exactly 1/UniverseLife and   
\- Let's see how a Universe would expand if that were true  
\- and let's compare it to the current Inflation + Big Bang model  
\- I've calculated the points and plotted it next to the standard model, here is the result:

&amp;#x200B;

[Constant H=1\/UL vs. Standard Model\(s\)](https://preview.redd.it/c4ngffsc73961.png?width=591&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bcc1d2f3d3b5e9158df7f8667176d834aa5bceff)

Key points:  
\- If the Universe expalnds with a fixed volume every second, then the Hubble constant will be 1/UL, thus making this graph  
\- This will make the Universe behave exactly like Inflation in the early stage (there is distance between the green and the blue line, but when you note that the range of time is from 1E-45 to 1E-35, you will confirm that they are practically on top of each other)  
\- But when the volume is big enough, the Universe starts behaving exactly like Big Bang expansion  
\- In the current moment both will yeld the current expanssion, hence H, but in the red theory, H is a coinckidy, where in the green it is consequence of the fact that the Universe expands with a fixed volume, every sedond  
\- In the future (waaay future future) Big Bang will start expanding exponentially, where green will eventually slow down, as the constant volume being pumped in will become neglegable next to the total volume of the Universe, so eventually -&gt; big crunch (seeding the next Universe?)

I was involved in a car crash several months and a thought came to me. I’ll just tel the whole story and then my question. 

So I was driving, I was accelerating to the speed limit(I think it was 55). And someone pulled out in front of me, she was attempting to cross a 5 lane highway.

After I hit her car, it slammed us together, and then it ping ponged me into a sign(wall). 

I hit the wall, the seatbelt caught me and it broke my collarbone. Clean break, down the center. I think I hit the wall going 30-40MPH(the police reported stated it but I can’t remember). 

They cut me out of the car, I sustained minor cuts in my left arm, a broken left collarbone and a broken right wrist, and a concussion. 

Anyway, sorry. I don’t quite know how to word this logically(?). I was wondering how much force I hit the wall with? Energy I dumped into the wall?.?

Trying To Understand e=mc 2,1609604613,"Hello physicists, I am not one.. at all. I barely understand rudimentary science, but am curious to know more. In fact, my question to you comes from me watching an American Dad episode just now.  

In the episode, they reference how Einstein had his thought expirement by traveling in a moving street car away from the clock tower in Switzerland, which is how he formulated his famous e=mc squared formula.  

Well, I know nothing about the formula, so I watched my first video on Youtube about it, and this is where I am stuck.  

In this video, at 5:24.... https://youtu.be/dht4OTVxpDw  

the physicist explains how there are two people playing catch. One is on top of a truck that is moving at 10 meters a second, and the other person is ahead of him waiting to catch the ball.  

I have a problem with this assumption, which would mean that Einstein is wrong and the theory of special relativity is wrong... lol...  

The assumption, which I find ridiculous, is that the person throwing the ball and the person receiving the ball would both see the same time.  

I don't think that's correct, and I think it can be easily disproved. If you recorded both these people with a camera and then reviewed the footage in slow motion, I'm pretty sure you would see different times on their wrist watches.  

For example, let's say we had one camera zoomed in on the thrower's wrist watch. Let's say that he begins to throw the ball at exactly 10:00am and 0 seconds. I believe it would take a few seconds for the ball to travel to the catcher. If you reviewed the footage of the second camera zoomed in on the receiver's wrist watch, I'm sure it would record something like 10:00am and 3 seconds.  

Those are different times. This seems pretty obvious.. what am I missing here?",Physics,AMagicWanderer,False,/r/Physics/comments/kp0aev/trying_to_understand_emc_2/

Non professional idea how anything exists,1609597240,"Physics help?
Disclaimer: I’m not smart or have any idea what I’m talking about got it all from google so it’s probably all wrong also I’m bad at explaining 


My constant existential crisis was peaking and I was thinking about that thing where it was like matter can’t be created or destroyed so I’m like well then how does anything exist right

So I google it and it’s something like it’s the energy in matter that can’t be created or destroyed bc matter is just energy except sometimes it’s created in small amounts and then immediately destroyed

Then i came across this thing called anti matter and it was saying like every matter has an anti matter that’s basically the same except with a different charge which is like negative and positive 

That would mean there’s positive and negative types of matter and anti matter? So like nothingness divided into positive matter, negative matter, positive anti matter,negative anti matter. This probably wrong but maybe energy I don’t even know

But it was like when the unlike charges combine they annihilate which is turning all the matter into 100% energy and it’s like gona disappear basically like a super over powered bomb type thing

So everyone’s like well if each matter has an anti matter they would all cancel out and leave everything into energy? so nothing could exist but clearly well I exist atleast so that didn’t happen, so one the theories was the ratio of matter to anti matter had to of been atleast 101:100 and that would explain why the anti matter is really rare or something but that wouldn’t make sense with the nothing can be created or destroyed because they couldn’t cancel out

So I tried to make idea I don’t know if it’s been made before probably has I’m not very original but I tried to make it make sense and for me to comprehend literally anything so I was like it couldn’t be there was an imbalance so maybe instead of that they just didn’t connect properly

This lowkey doesn’t make sense but i was like what if the positive anti matter combined with the positive matter and negative matter with the negative anti matter, so they couldn’t find the anti matter very much because they only found it whenever it was opposite charges but that’s when it’s doing the annihilating disappear into energy thing so it’s rare I guess and if the opposites didn’t combine that could explain why everything isn’t the energy and stuff exists I don’t know

Does Quantum Physics point to God's existence and idealism?,1609533488,"Hey, hi. I am not an expert on Physics or QM, though, lately, I have been hearing many theists bringing up Quantum Mechanics in order to prove cosmic consciousness and the idea that physical reality is just an illusion that is dependent/contingent on our mind and that materialism/naturalism has failed.

System of fly in a car,1609438303,"Hi, student here. I only have beginner’s knowledge in physics and don’t particularly like physics, but this question has been in my head for a few days now. 

I have a bit of background to understand somewhat of what a system is. Here goes: if a fly is flying in a moving car, which is traveling at 60 km/h, is the fly also flying at 60+ km/h? I know about inertia; for example when you jump on a moving bus, you’ll land in the same spot. But flies don’t jump, I don’t think. Also, does the answer change if a fly is flying in the car for a longer or shorter amount of time?

Any answers are appreciated!",Physics,loowhooshoo,False,/r/Physics/comments/knuyi1/system_of_fly_in_a_car/

Viscoelastic Fluids and Physics,1609418094,"Hello r/physics,

I have a genuine, bonafide question, that has just been bothering me for a few months now and I just can't get it out of my head.

I have been googling like crazy trying to find any information on this topic but can't seem to find something that clarifies my question other finding out what type of fluid saliva is. My education level in physics is highschool, not too much there to work with so I'm sorry, if this is a dumb question.

So my question is, due to the viscoelastic property of saliva and the capillary, viscous, elastic and inertial forces at work, is it possible for substances (anything really; ex: germs, matter, etc.) to travel back upwards to the source from which the saliva came from after coming into contact with a surface; consider the ""saliva strand"" still attached to the source.

Physics project- Foucault penulum,1609403480,"Hello!

I have about 3 weeks to do a physics for my school day.
At first, the Foucault penulum seemed to be an interesting topic, but since we are only the first grade od HS, I have realised that it was probably too complicated for me to make any sense of it. I do understand the jist od it, but I'm supposed to make a short video on it and this video would probably be just a minute which I think is a bit to short.

So, I have got 2 questions for you guys:

1. Should I countinue with this project, or is it too complicated for a 1st grader to understand (e.g. the math behind it)? 
If you think I should, do you have any literature or videos that explain the topic nicely? I watched few videos already, but I'm not happy with the understanding of the topic I got form it.

2. If you think I shouldn't do a project od Foucault, do you have any reccomendations about a different topic?
I'd like it to be something close to this, but not necessarily.

Are we inherently biased against deterministic theories?

Is this (seemingly) inherit bias against theories that imply free will doesn't exist a limitation of the capabilities of our minds?

[Question] how do we know there is any distinction between particles and waves?,1609308629,"Let me explain my thought process:   


When reading about Feynman's experiments with molecules and slits, he found the molecules he was testing with created interference patterns similar to light.. His conclusion (AFAIK) was that the molecules take every possible path through the slits to the destination, and this is how each particle ""receives"" information regarding the state of the slits... considering that light behaves similarly to the particles in that it contained dead spots after passing through the slits, how do we know that there is any distinction between particles and waves? Light behaves as a wave in this case with the peaks and troughs creating bright/dark spots, and it seems like the particles do something similar, but we also know light consists of photons... Could we not conclude that all particles are members of waves that permeate the universe with varying degrees of ""density?""

My thoughts on the creation of the universe,1609293673,"my daily existential crisis and trying to explain space to myself

before the big bang time did not exist due to gravity. the more gravity the more time itself is slowed down ie black holes and how an observer would see you falling in and just stopping altogether until the light shining off of you is redshifted. when the universe was the size of an electron time was so incredibly slowed down due to the gravity considering everything around us now was packed in there to the point that it could not exist.

black holes allow time to exist but since the big bang was not a neutron star that collapsed into a supernova and then became a black hole it had a different set of physics and laws. because obviously packing that much mass into an incredibly small space like that would form a black hole. for things to happen you need time to exist, but perhaps the gravity was somehow shifted, forming time

Some thoughts on “fictitious”/inertial forces,1609292391,"So I’m a physics major reading classical mechanics by Taylor, specifically the chapter about inertial forces. There’s a ton of detail about the centrifugal and Coriolis forces and I’m amazed by to find how significant of a place these forces have in classical mechanics. 

But I can’t help but remember in lower division physics when my professor referred to the centrifugal force as “fictitious”. This really bothered me because the effects of the centrifugal force are very real. But I understand the reasoning was because this force doesn’t follow the conventional definition as forces being an interaction between two objects. 

But doesn’t that tell us that maybe there’s something wrong with how we conventionally define what a force is? Given what I currently understand, I believe we should teach forces as existing in two different types. Noninertial/“conventional” forces that are an interaction between two objects. So like gravity and the Coulomb force of course. But then inertial forces that are a result of an attack object moving within an accelerated reference frame. This would mean we’d move away from the strict definition of forces being an interaction between two objects and include forces that are a result of an accelerating reference frame aka inertial forces.

This would eliminate the need to label inertial forces as “fictitious” because inertial forces would be included into the definition of what a force is. What do you guys think? I realize there’s probably/certainly already people who think of it this way but I wanted to discuss with people what your guys’ thoughts were on understanding inertial forces and whether or not the “fictitious” label is justified.

"Why is there no flux between cold winter air from outside, and hot air in my house when I open (a) window(s)?",1609250706,"For anyone who wants to just skip to the main question feel free to do so I appreciate any help with this greatly. I did want to ask another question down below as well though if anyone feels so inclined. Anyway I mostly want to know: *Why is it that when I open a window, even two windows up in my room upstairs, the hot air just sits in my room, even during winter?* 

The hot air doesn't travel outside to the colder air. I know hot air expands, so it should be expanding and moving outward towards the outside colder air. I do also know that cold air is denser than warm air, so maybe the flux from temperature and pressure are canceling out? Could it be that at the current temperatures I have experienced, the force driving the hot air out of my room from intramolecular energy, equals the same amount of force that is pushing the cold air into my room via air pressure, and those two values cancel out? If so, I would expect that at the point of contact between the two bodies of air, there would be a slow transfer of energy that would eventually lead to equilibrium over a long period of time. It does seem to be the case, that the temperature does ever so slowly become colder in my room. I do however have two windows open that are right next to each other. I also, have the bathroom door open with the small ceiling vent running, which may be the real cause for this, it's possible that the pressure coming from the bathroom vent is just enough to slowly pull the cold air in, but that would rely on my hypothesis that the reason no air is moving through is because the force pushing the hot air out is equal to the force pushing the cold air in, because the fan would have to be overcoming the force of the hot air moving outward for this to be the cause, no? 

Idk if any of you physicists are interested in HVAC, but my house is strange. It's always very hot upstairs in my room. And i know that in a closed system, hot air rises and (sort of) settles at the top, so it should be hotter upstairs. But it's abnormally hotter upstairs than it is downstairs. I live in a relatively small 2 story house, the second story floor is about 20 feet above the first story floor, so it shouldn’t be such a huge difference. The difference is usually at least 10°F. It can be really cold downstairs but hot enough to make you sweat upstairs. Seriously I mean there have been times where it feels like 65°F downstairs, and upstairs it will feel like 80°F, but the thermostat will say 72°. I think it's possible that the only thermometer for the thermostat is downstairs or something, maybe close to a vent, so that it can be hot upstairs, but the heat will keep going until the temp that's set is reached downstairs. There does seem to be a leak in the kitchen, there is a spot near the sink that I can feel cold air coming from, this makes sense because we had some mediocre crew install a new wall in the kitchen when a pipeline burst and destroyed everything, they ended up sealing up this wall very poorly I believe, I can see solid foam squares in the corner, not even glued onto the wall or anything, just shoved into the corner. However, this issue with the heat differential has always existed in this house, it's just worse now. I guess I'm just trying to ask this. *If you ignore the insulation leak, is it possible that the upstairs is always so hot compared to downstairs because the thermostat is only reading the temperature downstairs, and so it will continue to heat  everything until the downstairs temperature is at the setting, while the upstairs continues being flooded with heat?* 
Also during summer, the upstairs is also very very hot, and downstairs it is normal. The same thing happens, the thermostat will say 72°, but downstairs will reach that temp very quickly even though upstairs it's 85°-90°F. Sometimes it's strange though, on very hot days you can set the thermostat to 72°F on AC, and it will keep running because it won’t get colder than 74°F, but upstairs will be 90°F even though the air keeps running and the door to the stairs. is open

Tl;Dr. Want to know about question in title (in italics near top). And for second part, what to know if it's possible that if the upstairs is always at least 10°F hotter than downstairs, if that could be partly to blame on the thermometer only being located downstairs so the heat will keep running to get downstairs temperature up, while upstairs keeps getting hotter and hotter (highlighted near bottom).

To anyone who got this far... THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!! This has been something that I've been trying to figure out forever.

Pronunciation,1609232944,"Throughout physics (in the English speaking world), I feel there are a lot of places where names, words and letters from different languages are mispronounced so often that I feel it would be weird if I went around trying to pronounce them properly. For example:

I just watched a video where apparently the e in Hertz is pronounced slightly differently than what I've heard everywhere else. But because Hz is a common unit, it really is *everywhere* else that I've heard it wrong, and I would be weird if I started to pronounce it correctly. 

The letter pi in Greek is pronounced the same as the letter p in English. Which means that people generally shift the pronunciation of the letters that rhyme with pi in Greek (And p in English) so that they instead rhyme with pie. Which I makes sense for clarity's sake. But then I also hear weird things like not pronouncing the p in psi, which is done in Greek. Or vowel sound in tau completely changing pronunciation for no reason, to one of two alternatives. And apparently the consonant sound of chi is closer to ""h"" than a ""k"" (a friend from Greece pronounces it pretty much as ""he""). And then you have my engineering lecture and tutor pronouncing xi as eta and epsilon respectively (but I can blame that on them being engineers).

Physics question,1609226530,"This is going to appear to be an unscientific question and being a pet theory, but I have no interest in pursuit, I’m honestly just physics ignorant and was hoping for qualified help. I’m sure my terms are wrong and I apologize and will clarify as best I can. If you’re ok with this, my questions are below. 

Is there anywhere on earth that you can “turn up” gravity to exert more force on someone? 

Or, is it possible to create a place where one could “turn up” gravity. If so, what are the necessary conditions to “turn up” gravity? If the terms are relatively unknown, could you please give a short example of how you could create said conditions? (I saw the elevator example of increased speed creating more gravitational force but am wondering if there’s other examples of how to increase it).

"Forward moving flashlight VS stationary flashlight, would the light hit target at the same time?",1609226315,"To preface I’m not a physicist by any means, after some internet rabbit hole-ing I came across the “car traveling at the speed of light, headlight light wouldn’t move forward” question and it made me think about the speed of light in different situations then I hit a wall and thought I’d ask for some feedback. Here’s the problem-

If you set up two flashlights, one of them stationary and one designed to move forward at a predetermined speed, say 100 miles per hour and timed to turn on at the exact even point with the stationary flashlight, would one arrive first or would they hit at the same time?

My understanding is the speed of light is a hard cap, but I also understand that if I’m in a car and throw a baseball, the speed of the car and my throw are cumulative.

Falling from a great height into water while in a convertible car,1609210539,"Hi There, this is my first time making a post on reddit so if ive done anything wrong or anything id love to be corrected.
Ok so i was watching a film in which someone was in a convertible (this will become important in a sec) car and drove it off a cliff into water.
Obviously since it was a great height the surface tension of water would be incredibly high.
In the film they survived but i was wondering if there was a way that they could plausibly survive.
So assuming you are falling and you have maybe 10 seconds in the air before you got into the water.
In a convertible car that may be enough time to climb to the top of the car. (by the top i mean the back of the car as the front of the car was facing into the water in the film).
If you were to jump off the back of the car straight up and so you landed after the car. Would you be able to survive?
If the surface tension of the water was that of concrete, then surely the car would crumple and it would be like it crashed, but then after the initial impact, would the car go quickly into the water. As in by jumping up off the car, would you be able to gain enough time after the car has hit for the surface tension of the water to be broken (so therefore no real injuries to the person) but to have no car left above water so that you dont hit into the car.
If the car was fully below the water and you survived the initial impact as the surface was broken,i thin you  would you then still have enough velocity that you would hit into the car below the water. So then the safest method would be jumping slightly to the side of the car?
So that the surface is still broken but you wont hit into the car at any point.
so to sum up the above i was wondering the safest way in that situation to survive.
Lastly, would it be possible in that situation to jump so hard that you reduced your velocity substantially so that you had a softer impact
So as F=ma the force acting down on the person at any point would be 9.8m assuming acceleration is positive downwards.
To slow your approach down you would have to jump with a force lower than -F i believe?
would this then mean you have to jump with a acceleration upwards of -g?
Taking the example of me, I weigh roughly 80kg so i would have a force on me of 80g so i would have to apply any negative force to start to slow that. To be safest I would have to try and get my velocity to 0 in which case I need to accelerate in my jump with -80g.
So i can back squat roughly 150kg which means the weight/force of what I am squatting is 150g
So theoretically would i be able to start accelerating upwards so that i have a very reduced velocity when i were to land in the water so it is the most comfortable.
It is almost 3 am here and im tired so i have probably made a mistake somewhere but i thought it was interesting so if anyone has any answers or critiques or corrections or anything thatll be greatly appreciated",Physics,Pavandeep10,False,/r/Physics/comments/km5hjp/falling_from_a_great_height_into_water_while_in_a/

What about our electrical infrastructure?  Would our electrical grid, satellites, mobile communications die in a massive  zap? I can imagine planes falling from the sky and car suddenly stopping affected by global EMP.

Last question, assuming that the burst last a couple of hours (or even seconds), only one half of the earth will be expose to the gamma ray burst, right? so half will die, while the other survive? Or the gamma rays will go through the earth like neutrinos affecting everything?

What are the likelihoods of getting accepted into a top 30 PhD program?,1609122987," I’m currently a junior physic/math student attending a top 25 physic university in the US. Her are my stats:

Grades: For my GPA, anything prior to this semester(FALL 2020) I had pretty much all A and A-, with lot more A than A- in core courses. However, this semester I end up doing particularly badly for one course: Mechanics, which I got a B in. I personally believe I know the materials pretty well, however, we only had 1 final and I ended up kept on making simple derivations errors(constantly going back changing which led to times up). By the time of application tho I should end up with a \~3.8 GPA (though not at all impressive)

Research Experience: Not much!!! This turned out to be a total disaster for me. I had plans to do research in AMO during the summer but covid hit, and I basically ended up doing nothing in summer, other than doing a lot coding for personal interest. This fall semester I took over a grad student’s project and since then it has doomed me. That grad student AND the prof didn’t know what was going on with the device and so I have to figure out why by myself, and because covid hit, I stayed home for class and so I have to ride a 3hr train to campus every time when trying to work on the project(so back and forth 6hrs). This is on top of me having to take 5 major classes and 1 elective.

With regards to the PGRE, I think I can ace it easily since without practice I got a 910 on a sample test

LOR: I’m really not sure what to say about this, but one of the prof I intended to ask is a pioneer in the field(however he’s very, very old), the other two LOR will prob come from an REU prof (assuming if I get in) and a prof I planned on working with the next semester.

Discussing NdFeB Magnet behavior in a Controllable Vacuum,1609106489,"I've been on and off the research over the last 7 ish years on vacuum systems and the use of permanent magnets of the NdFeB variety so I may be off on some of what I'm talking about as it could be old information/research.

I've recently (2 months ago) learned of magpylib for using python to analyze and graph magnets in 2d space and potentially 3d space as well.

**My goal**: Using a torus structure, I am trying to move a cylindrical object through a vacuum using magnetic repulsion.  The vacuum pressure is controllable, and so is the strength of the magnetic walls of the torus. With higher magnetic force applied from the walls, it's my understanding that the stronger the repulsion should be on the cylinder. This gives speed to the cylinder and can be used to generate a current on a wire inside the cylinder which is meant to be captured either into a mechanical form (flywheel) or a battery storage.

I've looked at the ""power walls"" of DIYers using 18650 batteries but am also starting to look at 2170 batteries as an alternative to 18650s.

One thing I am asking is to verify or to tell me I'm wrong - the acceleration of the cylinder would only be if I were to further reduce the pressure of the vacuum from 0.5atm to say 0.3atm? Speed would be constant in a vacuum so I think this would mean that the only way to increase 

Questions I have about this is where are there issues besides possible eddy currents or friction leading to a temperature increase in the vacuum chamber?

As of the last 4 weeks I've taken a whole new look at this system - I looked at the cylinder as a particle and one property I quickly found was that it's position would oscillate and if I consider the cylinder as a signal then I can say the signal oscillates as well.  This may seem a little strange but I didn't think to think of the system in such a way.

Anyway I also worked out another detail - if I could find the arc length with 90deg given radius of 4ft then I got to 6.283ft (2pi ft) travelled in 1 second.  I converted this into a table of this form:

Time | Position | Velocity | Pressure  
\------------------------------------------------------  
t0 = 0   p0 = 0       v0 = 0        P0 = .5atm.

**TLDR**:: Trying to see if it is possible to generate electricity using a vacuum chamber shaped as a torus with 2 controllable variables:  1. vacuum pressure and 2. the magnetic strength of the walls of the chamber.

Einsteins theory of relativity WRONG! Prove me wrong,1609080960," 

As many may be aware, what's on my mind is the end of Einstein's Special Relativity. Why? you may ask. Because it is based on false assumptions. Not only that, but physicists have corrupted the rules of logic as they apply to Special Relativity. Then they make false assertions, that comply with the physicists' definition of logic, so you (or I) can't argue against them. Here is the dirty secret about what they have done. 

The fundamental flaw of Special Relativity is the presumption, like most physics, that there are ONLY 4 dimensions. This was enough for Galileo and Newton, but neither of them was good enough to handle relativistic velocity. Praytell, why is Special Relativity allowed to describe its peculiarities in ONLY 4 dimensions? What they have done is merged two coordinate systems into one.

In simple terms, 4 dimensions WAS enough, once upon a time. But the fundamental error was thinking that any relativistic behavior was parallel to ANY of the 4 dimensions of STATIC reality. Clearly, relativistic velocities are not static. And relativistic velocities are parallel to an Imaginary twin of each of the nominal 4. They are perpendicular to all 4 and each other. Among other things, the magnitude of these Imaginary terms is directly proportional to Proper velocity (another subject which physicists are reluctant to discuss because it violates their cherished absolute speed limit). This means that at very small velocities, there are 4 dimensions, after all.

At relativistic velocities, there are 8 dimensions required to account for relativity. However, thanks to 3D rotation symmetry, a relativistic velocity vector can always be oriented parallel to a single dimension, usually the x axis. Since the other two dimensions are unaffected by a Lorentz transform,, we can pare down the number of required dimensions to 4, a Real and an Imaginary for both space and time vectors. When the Real and Imaginary parts are added together as vectors, their sum is Complex, and nobody noticed, it is INVARIANT with respect to relative velocity.

Instead Special Relativity concocts the fairy tale about length contraction. Question: How does an invariant length contract with increasing relative velocity? Answer: IT DOESN'T. It only looks that way because our instrumentation is not designed to measure Complex quantities. And relatively moving intervals ARE Complex quantities. But according to Einstein, these intervals are physical, too. But Einstein makes the supreme error of assuming that because the magnitude in polar coordinates is the same as the magnitude of its Real projection, which is part of the Cartesian coordinates, that this relationship extends into relativistic velocities. In truth, the apparent magnitude of the Complex radius vector is the Real projection of the invariant Complex total. While these two are identical at Newtonian velocities, relative velocity increases the projection angle, which decreases the cosine. At relativistic speeds, the Real projection could be almost 0. In fact, if you simply define measurement as the dot product of the invariant Complex magnitude and a single Real reference unit from the relatively stationary frame, you get (for length) r' = r cos(angle). That is simple geometry. It is also equivalent to sec(angle) r' = r = γr', where γ is the Lorentz factor for relative velocity = c sin(angle). We measure 100% of what the Universe allows. It's the tilt of the axis that is responsible for the foreshortened Real projection.

So, you see the confidence we place in physical measurements is unjustified. It is a defect of our measuring devices that they cannot measure Imaginary components, so physicists were forced to accept a fairy tale about length contraction, as opposed to a simple rigid rotation into higher dimensions.

Here's the deal. I will retract what I have posted about Special Relativity and abandon my research, if a single person can refute my argument. But there's a catch. My premise is that Special Relativity is based on false premises, and were it not for the exception to the rules invoked by denial of an objective reality, it would also be full of contradictions. Not the bedrock I would build anything on. Since that is the premise, you may not use any argument that is based on Special Relativity. You may call that cheating, but I call it leveling the playing field. According to the rules of classic Greek logic, in a proof by contradiction, one assumes the opposite of the premise one wants to prove. Then if, through a series of logical arguments, it leads to any contradiction, then the original premise cannot be true. So if anyone can, through logical arguments, demonstrate that my argument leads to an internal contradiction, that is the only rebuttal which is acceptable.  If no one can find such an argument, that doesn't prove I am right. 

However, there are powerful arguments that prove Special Relativity contradicts itself. And the irony is that all the experiments that supposedly confirm Special Relativity only confirm the accuracy of the Lorentz Transform. And it is the Lorentz Transform that proves Special Relativity is self-contradictory. By the way, if you think you can weasel out of using the unrestricted rules of logic because there is no objective reality, it's only because mainstream physics hasn't found it yet. It exists, because I did find it. And it skewers Special Relativity. Think I'm lying? Call my bluff. Post a rebuttal. So, how long should it take to disprove my claim if it's just fiction? An hour? a day? a week? a month? How about if I get no credible replies in a month, I declare myself the winner, and proceed from there?",Physics,JonnyHa_,False,/r/Physics/comments/kl4wp2/einsteins_theory_of_relativity_wrong_prove_me/

Is it possible infinity doesn’t exist?,1609042149,"So kinda a high thought while listening to Neil degrasse Tyson on joe Rogan lol. But, there would be 2 separate conditions that would make infinity possible, the first being that the universe lasts forever and never has an ending point. the second would be that there is a multiverse, where either black holes contain another universe or the smallest pieces of matter contain another universe; or both but those are the two likely scenarios for alternate universe due to mathematics being so crucial in everything in the universe, a fractal pattern of alternate universes could be possible/likely. But then there could still be a limit restricted by the exact amount of atoms in the universe. 

My thinking on this is, that let’s say if there was an infinity of events that take place such as the moment you’re reading this right now there’s infinite changes that could happen in different universes, or repeats in history if time is infinite but repetitive and ever changing, where this exact scenario could happen but your sitting an atom more to the right, or maybe you’re a fucking serial killer. Regardless there are changes, but the question it would come down to is the permutation of all the atoms in the universe and where they could be. This is where space would come into play, but space can’t be infinite if the Big Bang theory is true bc according to the Big Bang theory it all started from this infinitesimally small point that began to rapidly expand, which implies that there is either a limited amount of atoms In existence in the universe, or depending on if time doesn’t go on for infinity, which would make this irrelevant and something we’ll never know, there will be a set point in which universal expansion halts and everything collapses or seizes to exist. Regardless my thought process is that the only possible way that infinity could be possible is if time was infinite and there was an ever lasting source creating more atoms and feeding them into the universe.

Interesting commonality between statistics and entropy and quantum mechanics,1609032161,"So prior to learning about entropy and having a superficial look into quantum mechanics aswell, i always somehow thought statistics and thus probabilities is such an essential mathmatical field that i felt like it is more essential than other mathmatical fields.

Like don‘t get me wrong maybe i am overexagerating the meaning of probabilities but it seems to be core to all math and physics, at least for me. Humans seem to inherit the reasoning through probabilities without neccessarily consciously bringing it up.
And then guess what i heard about a new quantum computer basically operating on probabilities aswell, because the light of a laser can hit the splitting surface in exactly such a way that a given outcome is 50% on happening so that it can operate mutiple operations at once, when i am not mistaken ofc. 

WTF probabilities seem to be so general in the role of determining physical reality.

Where would you find severe sideways/horizontal turbulence (the type of turbulence that's dangerous to airliners)?,1609030366,"Generally turbulence is up and down motions in an airliner.

As Δp becomes larger, the probabilities that a single photon is of high momentum increase. Still right?  But is this uncertainty only about the direction or equally about the amplitude of the vector?

Trying to fully understand the concept of Electric Potential,1608985251,"Just for context I'm on my 4th year of university studying Physics. The concept of electric potential (EP) has always been vague and abstract to me and I've finally come to a point where I want to understand it fully.

I've worked through the derivation of EP and Electric Potential Energy (EPE) using the concept of a path independent conservative field (or force). I perfectly understand the concept of EPE. What confuses me, is that everyone says that the EP at a point is the amount of work done to bring the unit positive charge from infinity to that point. But strictly speaking this doesn't seem true, since the equation is literally V = W/q and the ""work"" done is actually divided by the the charge of the test particle in question. So what we have on the right hand side doesn't seem like ""work""... So how can I better understand this concept of EP which seems (from my perspective) to have been given a flawed definition by many people??

The right hand side of this equation is actually the integral evaluation of the electric field E = F/q with distance. And since strictly speaking the electric field is not a force, this shouldn't actually constitute work, right??

I have a similar miss-understanding of what the electric field is fundamentally. I have been thinking of it as a the characterization of charge with distance. In fact I find the equation E = F/q itself confusing, as it is hard to imagine what a force divided by charge represents. It feels as though I am missing something...

Aside from the engineering details, I’m just curious if my thinking on the physics challenge with this is correct... we would need to use an EM source like radio or microwaves waves that have a wavelength to penetrate our fat and tissue etc and pass through the arteries. However these same EM sources that can pass through our neck, wouldn’t scatter off of any particles/cells in our blood since they are much smaller in diameter than these wavelengths. Also I guess the challenge of passing these sources all the way through the neck to the other side where a detector of some kind would pose a big challenge probably lol I’m just brain storming the idea I guess and wondering if my thinking on the challenges posed are correct?

Quantum Entanglement Question,1608894437,"Hey all, first post here.

To keep it short, my understanding is that, when entangling two pure quantum states, we get a resulting quantum state in which the sums of the properties of the original states can be known, but measuring a single property of one of the original quantum states breaks down the entanglement (decoheres the 2 systems? excuse my lack of technical terms).

If we apply this to quantum computer logic, does this mean that, by planning carefully which systems to entangle together and with which logic, I can apply a ""common denominator"" logic and actually know the properties of the single states without ever having to measure them? 

Example below.

Disclaimer: This abstraction will be extremely simplistic and not applicable in real life, it's just an abstract example to show the underlying logic.

Let's treat a flower as a pure quantum state, let's say it has properties of height, width and color, and let's examine it's height property.

Let's entangle 2 of those flowers together.

Flower A can be 1, 2 or 3 metres high.

Flower B can be 4, 5 or 6 metres high.

After entanglement, I might observe that the entangled system has an height of 7 metres.

This, unfortunately, could mean many combinations: A=1 B=6, A=2 B=5, A=3 B=4.

In this case, I cannot determine the height of the single flowers.

Now, enter flowers C and D.

Flower C = 10, 20, 30 metres.

Flower D = 100, 200, 300 metres.

If I measure the entangled system and find out that it has an height of 220 metres, then, without measuring the single flowers, the only solution MUST be Flower C = 20 metres and Flower D = 200 metres, meaning that, without measuring the single flowers, I can still know exactly their height property without breaking entanglement.

Can anyone point out if there are any flaws in the reasoning appplied to this flowery abstract system ?

Physicists prove the existence of two-dimensional particles called 'anyons',1608810553,"
This year, physicists gave us an early view of a third kingdom of quasiparticles that only arise in two dimensions.

After decades of exploration in nature’s smallest domains, physicists have finally found evidence that anyons exist. First predicted by theorists in the early 1980s, these particle-like objects only arise in realms confined to two dimensions, and then only under certain circumstances — like at temperatures near absolute zero and in the presence of a strong magnetic field.

Physicists are excited about anyons not only because their discovery confirms decades of theoretical work, but also for practical reasons. For example: Anyons are at the heart of an effort by Microsoft to build a working quantum computer.

This year brought two solid confirmations of the quasiparticles. The first arrived in April, in a paper featured on the cover of Science, from a group of researchers at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris. Using an approach proposed four years ago, physicists sent an electron gas through a teeny-tiny particle collider to tease out weird behaviors — especially fractional electric charges — that only arise if anyons are around. 

The second confirmation came in July, when a group at Purdue University in Indiana used an experimental setup on an etched chip that screened out interactions that might obscure the anyon behavior.

MIT physicist Frank Wilczek, who predicted and named anyons in the early 1980s, credits the first paper as the discovery but says the second lets the quasiparticles shine. “It’s gorgeous work that makes the field blossom,” he says. Anyons aren’t like ordinary elementary particles; scientists will never be able to isolate one from the system where it forms. 

They’re quasiparticles, which means they have measurable properties like a particle — such as a location, maybe even a mass — but they’re only observable as a result of the collective behavior of other, conventional particles. 

(Think of the intricate geometric shapes made by group behavior in nature, such as flocks of birds flying in formation or schools of fish swimming as one.)

The known universe contains only two varieties of elementary particles. One is the family of fermions, which includes electrons, as well as protons, neutrons, and the quarks that form them. Fermions keep to themselves: No two can exist in the same quantum state at the same time. 

If these particles didn’t have this property, all matter could simply collapse to a single point. It’s because of fermions that solid matter exists.

The rest of the particles in the universe are bosons, a group that includes particles like photons (the messengers of light and radiation) and gluons (which “glue” quarks together). Unlike fermions, two or more bosons can exist in the same state at the same time.

They tend to clump together. It’s because of this clumping that we have lasers, which are streams of photons all occupying the same quantum state.

Anyons don’t fit into either group. What makes anyons especially exciting for physicists is they exhibit something analogous to particle memory. If a fermion orbits another fermion, its quantum state remains unchanged. Same goes for a boson.

Anyons are different. If one moves around another, their collective quantum state shifts. It might require three or even five or more revolutions before the anyons return to their original state. 

This slight shift in the wave acts like a kind of memory of the trip. This property makes them appealing objects for quantum computers, which depend on quantum states that are notoriously fragile and prone to errors. Anyons suggest a more robust way to store data.

Wilczek points out that anyons represent a whole “kingdom” containing many varieties with exotic behaviors that can be explored and harnessed in the future. 

He began thinking about them about 40 years ago in graduate school, when he became frustrated with proofs that only established the existence of two kinds of particles.

He envisioned something else, and when asked about their other properties or where to find these strange in-betweeners, half-jokingly said, “anything goes” — giving rise to the name.

Now, he says, the new studies are just the beginning. Looking forward, he sees anyons as a tool for finding exotic states of matter that, for now, remain wild ideas in physicists’ theories

Trying to comprehend special relativity (question),1608765896,"Hey,

So, I'm literally just some kid going through IB physics at the moment, but besides that the true source of this question is from films, like interstellar. I have many thought experiments about time, but I'm especially curious about special relativity, or space time dilation.

Mainly, I'm confused by it and the explanations offered.

You see, the thing is, in my thoughts, I seem to think that speed has no effect on time. That it only affects the perception of time. 

In consideration of the popular example that observer is moving away from a clock at increasingly high speeds, nearing the speed of light, it is said that time slows down, to the extent of stopping at the speed of light. Furthermore this is presented in the movie Interstellar with the fact that the father's (who goes to space) own daughter surpasses his age due to this.

BUT, this has me massively confused. To me it would make far more sense to state that time is constant, and that only our perceptions of it can change, right? Considering that same experiment once more, can't we tell that that clock is still moving in time just as it would be otherwise, just that the moving observer can't perceive that change due to restrictions from light? And that, more importantly, since this is purely a perception, that that observer is also moving no different through time? It makes no sense to me that they would age any slower, just because the way they perceive something is different.

Cannot resolve my understanding on data/current relationship in computing,1608764769,"Hey there; I’m a 3rd year physics major and deeply curious about many aspects of computing. For some reason I can’t understand the entire fundamental process of computation in say a cpu. I understand that the data is ‘in’ the current passing over ‘wires’ and that it’s not about the charges themselves moving but the electric field generated by moving these charges. Now the electric field I know comes from a voltage... this same voltage is generated across the source and load of this given wire in question let’s say. However what generated that voltage? Like I understand to the point where the software compiles, to binary, and this corresponds directly to these generated on/off or high/ low voltages that transmit data through their corresponding E field. However like what ‘reads’ the binary? I don’t understand the physics of compiles binary from a script to the components of the pc ‘reacting’ to follow these instructions. And vice versa how the resulting voltages/fields sent ‘back’ get pumped back into machine code to the software side of things. I’m sorry if I have made wrong assumptions here, or if my thinking is unclear etc. I just have a burning desire to know this and I cannot wrap my head around how this is being done at a fundamental level.

Just “failed” my first semester of grad school,1608728455,"Just “failed” my first semester of grad school

Hi all. I (20s, F) just started a PhD program in physics this semester despite wanting to go into astronomy. I was worried about going into a classical physics program when my physics was weaker than my astronomy and there was only one astronomy class available, but I really wanted to take part in the research my advisor is doing, so I went. I’m good at research and published as first author and nth author on two papers in undergrad, so I’m not completely dumb, just in physics classes apparently.

I just got my final grades and received C’s in both my physics courses, and an A in my planetary science course, which was an elective. So, I now have a 2.5 GPA and am on academic probation.

I’ve never had such a low GPA in my life; I had over a 4.0 in high school and never dropped below a 3.0 in any given semester in undergrad, was on the dean’s list many semesters and ended with a 3.49, but I’m not sure what to make of any of that because I struggled so hard with my physics courses this semester. I felt like, despite having taken and done pretty well in all of the undergraduate prereqs for those courses (barring one) that I didn’t know what the hell I was doing in either of those courses all semester, and despite working closely with one of the professors all semester, nothing improved.

Basically, I’m feeling dumb af and feeling pretty hopeless. I am super excited about the research I’m doing with my advisor this coming semester, but it’s not going to matter too much if I get kicked out after next semester, I don’t even know if I’ll get to keep my assistantship now. One of my professors straight up told me that where I stand right now, I will not pass quals.

I’m not sure if I should start looking to reapply to grad programs in astronomy that I will actually succeed in, but I don’t want to leave the research, the town, and my advisor. Then again, I might get kicked out so I might not have a choice. Also, I now have a 2.5 GPA in grad school, I don’t think anyone would accept that GPA even if it was in a slightly different field.

Of course, the best solution would be for me to get over a 3.0 next semester so I bring my GPA back up and get out of academic probation, which I’m going to try my hardest to do. But I also want to be realistic in that my classes are only going to get harder from here and it’s a real possibility that I might not get high enough grades to pull myself out probation.

How do I interpret the probability arising from schrodingers equation?,1608726211,"Let say I solved the Schrodinger equation for a wave-packet and I integrate the probability density function between points A and B and it tells me there is a 10% chance of finding the particle there.

What on earth does this mean? 

There isn't a single definition of probability that gives a satisfactory answer. In fact every definition admits that it has serious flaws.

Example: Frequentist would say, oh well just imagine you do this experiment an infinite number of times and you will find that when you divide the number of times you found the particle (between A and B) by the number of times you ran the experiment you will get 0.1   
Problem: There is no reason why you couldn't measure the particle between A and B every time. For the same reason you could throw a dice and get 6 every time. Even when doing it infinitely many time. The frequentist would answer, yeah well but the probability of that happening is infinitely small. Ehm but wait what do you mean with probability? oh well just imagine you do this experiment an infinite number of times... and so on and so on.

And then there is Bayesian probability. Which would only work if we presuppose there is hidden information that determines the outcome of the experiment that the experimenter is not aware of. But as far as I know the ""hidden variables"" hypothesis has been put to bed by Bell's theorem. 

So in short, what do I make of this 10% ?

"I think the concept of time dilation and special relativity ""clicked"" for me last night, can you please confirm my explanation?",1608706466,"I understood that time dilation happened, but couldn't wrap my head around why.

Can someone just let me know if any of these statements might be false, before I go full Albert on my fam and friends? Haha, cheers.  


1. Universally speaking, an objects speed can only be expressed as it relates to another objects speed, because there is no frame of reference, as everything is moving. On earth speed is discussed as a fixed expression, unless otherwise stated, it is assumed to be in relation to standstill.
2. We see objects because light reflects off of them and them into our eyes.
3. If a person travelled at light speed, looking  backward at a clock like Einstein imagined, the clock  would stand perfectly still.
4. And this was the part that I never connected that many videos would just gloss over. I never got why the clock Einstein looked at stood still. I've known about how light and vision works, just never applied it in this scenario... So, time isn't really ""time"", a clock just represents the sun's movement. Scientifically time is just the way we interpret entropy. And that movement, that unfolding of the universe, is... time... I can see it in my head now as one thing, spacetime. I can do that now because last night I had the following revelation...
5. The clock stood still because at light speed, the light being reflected off the clock towards Alberts's eyes would never be able to catch up to his eyes. It would always be JUST out of reach.
6. Time is slightly faster for Joe taking a walk, than Lucy sitting down because Joe's speed equals however fast he is moving through space, say *x* km/h plus his walking speed. Lucy is ""only"" lol, travelling at *x.* So Joe is travelling a TINY fraction faster than her through space. If they both were witnessing the same airplane flying by, it would appear (although not noticeably) to be faster or slower for one or the other (depending on the direction everything) because the light is entering their eyes at different rates. Intuition says that means the light must be entering their eyes at different speeds, but that's impossible as light is constant. That's where I kept dying before, but if I keep my newfound understanding of spacetime in mind you see how/why it is spacetime that is altered and not the light as intuition leads one to believe.

=======================

I also have three questions.

Q1, In number 5- does this mean that Albert would see random lights flashing, stuff interspersed with nothingness? Because nothing heading towards his eyes will catch up, his eyes wont catch up with any light running away from his direction, and some light would intersect with his eyes, which he would see.)

Q2. If leaving earth at light speed time slows, what happens if he heads straight back, and stared at the clock, and had really good eyes, would the clock speed up? 

Q3. How fast ARE we moving through space? Is it, us plus earth's spin speed? Does it end there? Or do we add orbit speed, the sun's orbit speed, the galaxies movement speed? Since everything in the milky way is ""attached"" via gravity, and galaxies move, are we moving as fast as a galaxy if you really boil it down? 

===============

It's hard keeping several of those concepts in my head at once. It feels intuitive, but realizing the light couldn't catch up to Albert's eyes was the real missing puzzle piece for me, which is one of the most basic pieces I feel now haha. But it glued so much together. At least I think, so please let me know where I might be misunderstanding things before. Fun fact, I was on a bunch of acid when it happened haha.

Are Light Waves Sinusoidal?,1608668764,"The only physics course I've taken was in high school, and that
was a long time ago.
 
Electromagnetic radiation is always depicted as sine waves.  The
only exceptions are when the artist has apparently done a poor job
of drawing the wave, and a sine wave shape was probably intended.
 
When more detail is shown, it is a sinusoidal electric wave and a
sinusoidal magnetic wave at right angles to each other, in phase,
and with equal amplitudes.
 
That electromagnetic waves would naturally have sinusoidal shape
makes intuitive sense, since a very wide range of processes result
in harmonic oscillations.  This idea was suggested in a film in my
physics class, in which a point on the edge of a rotating wheel
is seen to oscillate harmonically when viewed edge-on.
 
Does electromagnetic radiation really have sinusoidal waveform?

What exactly do physicists enjoy about physics if they are aware that physics models aren't necessarily the reality of nature?,1608610598,"Hi there! I am an undergraduate student interested in physics. My knowledge about the field is very basic, so I apologize in advance if my following paragraphs contain any misunderstandings about physics! 

I am currently confused with what about physics that physicists gain pleasure in. I have always been hearing that physicists are curious about nature and why things are the way they are. 

However, I also learned from professionals that physicists shouldn't think that physics is *the* reality. First, we may *never* be certain if our models are *the* correct ones. For example, we once thought that Classical Mechanics is *the one*. Secondly, one phenomenon may be described &amp; predicted by various models. Last but not least, physics uses math as the tool, but then there are *Gödel's incompleteness* theorems... 

This made me wonder what exactly do physicists enjoy about physics if they are aware that physics models aren't necessarily the reality of nature? Especially that the why's physics answered may not be the real reasons for nature's behaviours.

I am pretty new to quantum mechanics, and I was wondering whether someone can please assist me with the following question:

Consider a particle with mass m in an infinite square well potential with length a. Say the potential is V(x) = 0 for 0 &lt;= x &lt;= a and V(x) -&gt; infinity elsewhere.

(c) A photon is injected into the square well and excites the particle from the lowest state into the next higher one. Find an expression for the wavelength of the photon needed.

I am a master's student coming to terms with the fact that the time has come to apply for a PhD position. Some would even say I am late.

This said, I come to you redditors asking for general advice on even HOW to look for a position that would be satisfying to me and not having me begging for money on the streets. How did you approach your search and how did you make sure to end up in a position you would like?

Physics of rotation in a human body question,1608413198,"Hi there can anyone possibly explain or link a video that explains how a human body can generate power and efficiently transfer that power through the body to expel it through the arms?

For reference this is mostly directed at sports, specifically targeting athletes that rotate in their sport like golfers, baseball players, pitchers, where they use vertical and horizontal ground pressures while also torquing their hips and torso to amplify power generated with the goal of efficiently transferring energy to their arms to release it into the end of the golf club, baseball bat, and baseball.

Anatomically it is important for the legs and other body parts to be in certain positions while in motion in order to transfer power to the next part of the body efficiently.

If an athlete generates too much power too fast they can ruin the transfer of the energy since structure of the body cannot handle the load requirements to efficiently transfer that power. Also going too slow can short circuit power transfer and the athlete would then try to speed up mid action to compensate for failing to produce enough power in the body structure but this can easily throw them off as well.",Physics,voiceimpressions110,False,/r/Physics/comments/kggo6n/physics_of_rotation_in_a_human_body_question/

Derivation of velocity from acceleration with functional equations,1608386242,"TLDR/ we solved a differantial equation with functional equations and compositions. Do you know the name of what we did? Do you know any examples or books&amp;book parts related to this thing?

Hello, Currently i am in a language prep school before my physics major, but we study math and physics with one of physics professors. We first learned how to solve for f(x) in some functional equations like 2f(1-x)+1=xf(x) with using functional compositions. Then we looked at this compositions relation with groups. 

Then we solved this problem with what we learned: An object with mass m launched towards earth with a speed Vo and this object experiences air resistance force F=-kv. Find the speed of the object as a function of time?

We didn't solved this by directly taking the integral of  mg-kv=m . dv/dt , we stated a=-(k/m)(v-mg/k) and then through some theorems and lemmas we arrived at a functional equation F(x+y)=f(x).f(y), 

f(x)=(Vx-mg/k)/(Vo-mg/k). 

We solved this with Euler's number definition as limit and formal definition of the derivative as a limit, a=  limit of a(avg) as *h*→0 =  limit of \[Vt+h - Vt\]/*h* as *h*→0. 

so we finally found Vt= mg/k + (Vo-mg/k).e\^-kt/m

The double-slit experiment,1608383562,"Hello, I have just gotten into quantum mechanics and I was introduced to the double-slit experiment. I found it very interesting that the particles acted as matter once it was observed. As I do not have a full understanding of this topic I was wondering if this has something to do with the quantum entanglement as once the particles were observed they are no longer in a superposition meaning that the particles then would act as matter instead of waves. So if this was the case is it possible that we can untangle the particles or if we were to add another particle to the entanglement would the particle in the experiment act as waves throughout even though it is observed? As I have said I don't have a full understanding of this topic or anywhere close to having a full understanding of this topic so I was just curious and I do realize that this whole statement may be invalid.",Physics,Ch0mpChum,False,/r/Physics/comments/kg7i0g/the_doubleslit_experiment/

Time travel - visuals from the past possible? (Theory),1608378826,"I don’t know if this is the right place to post this but I just came up with a theory.

Time travel seems almost impossible and I agree. Many paradoxes come into play like: “what if you kill your grandfather?” etc.

But for me it sounds very possible to pick up in the past emitted signals from the brain and create a visual out of that. Allow me to explain:

Matter is never destroyed (it can be transformed but can’t be destroyed). Our brain is constantly sending out waves in the Universe (possibly radiowaves or some other type).

If we somehow manage to pick up the radio- or other in the past emitted waves (let’s say 500 years ago), could we create a visual reconstruction in POV vision of that person 500 years ago?

It sounds possible in theory.

"If I wanted to prove a multi-variable mathematical model using an experiment, but I could not control all the variables that are traditionally supposed to be controlled, how should I design the experiment?",1608376379,"Hi y'all,

Hope you're doing Great, sorry about the title it's a mouthful I know. I desire to know more about some topics, but I don't know how to communicate what I want very well so sorry for the half-baked questions. Feel free to share with me. So here goes:

1) The scientific method: science 101 is that when you have a theoretical single-variable or multi-variable mathematical model of a process or phenomenon of some kind, where you can control all variables but two, then you control all those variables then select amongst the two a variable to be changed (independent) and a variable to be measured (dependent). You run the experiment, maybe repeat it a few times to get more data.

Correct me if I'm wrong: afterwards statistics is used to give you confidence whether the experiment results lean more toward your theoretical model or that it's actually not. **Is this correct?**

2) If this was actual research, and your statistics checked out, **I assume you would publish it?** Somebody somewhere who's interested would poke your theory then repeat the experiment and check the results to either support or oppose your theoretical model, **right?**

3) Moving on. **Are there times when due to the nature of the experiment, you can't: control all variables but two, have one independent and one dependent variables?**

4) In college I had a thermo course where we learned about the equation of state and how there were some theories and related equations giving mathematical models of the equation of state. I honestly can't remember but there were some complicated plots all over the course. Perhaps this is related somehow to question 3.

5) Here's a question: if the answer to question 3 is yes, **how would a scientist go about validating the multivariable mathematical function?**

6) **What would the statistics part entail, broadly speaking?**

For single-variable functions, if the theoretical function is a straight line for example, then you run an experiment at values (that you selected) of the independent variable. Then for statistics, you do regression or stuff like that. That's almost all I know of statistics.

So it's hard for me to imagine the statistical approach when you have more than one variable, I mean... what if your mathematical model is a plane or some crazy surface. What are the experimental points that I need then?

7) **Is the statistics topic of multivariate analysis relevant here?** Not that I know what multivariate analysis is, all I know of it is its name really.",Physics,Pahriuon,False,/r/Physics/comments/kg60x8/if_i_wanted_to_prove_a_multivariable_mathematical/

My question is if you could hold the sun in place, would that speed up the orbital period of Jupiter in this case? (I’m thinking it would because the orbit I think would end up describing a smaller circle)

Also if you replaced Jupiter in the above example with say earths moon (at The same distance from the sun) would it have the same orbit period?

Presidential Letter: Defending APS Core Values &amp; Executive Order 13950,1608235990,"I just received a letter from APS. This is an excerpt from the letter:

&gt;Both of these executive actions \[Executive Order 13950 and an associated memorandum\] are in direct opposition to the core values of the American Physical Society and negatively impact our community as a whole. They run counter to current efforts by federal agencies, contractors and grantees to foster a more inclusive and equitable work environment and are detrimental to efforts to address discrimination based on race or gender identity.

I've looked up Executive Order 13950, and on it's face the language and intention seems laudable.

&gt;Race or sex stereotyping is defined as “ascribing character traits, values, moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs to a race or sex, or to an individual because of his or her race or sex.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Race or sex scapegoating is defined as “assigning fault, blame, or bias to a race or sex, or to members of a race or sex because of their race or sex.”  
&gt;  
&gt;The Order also identifies the following nine prohibited training concepts that are derived from race or sex stereotyping and scapegoating:  
&gt;  
&gt;One race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex;  
&gt;  
&gt;The United States is fundamentally racist or sexist;  
&gt;  
&gt;An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously;  
&gt;  
&gt;An individual should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his or her race or sex;  
&gt;  
&gt;Members of one race or sex cannot and should not attempt to treat others without respect to race or sex;  
&gt;  
&gt;An individual’s moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex;  
&gt;  
&gt;An individual, by virtue of his or her race or sex, bears responsibility for actions committed in the past by other members of the same race or sex;  
&gt;  
&gt;Any individual should feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; and  
&gt;  
&gt;Meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist or sexist, or were created by a particular race to oppress another race.

Question about Black Holes,1608185893,"So I was doing a bit of physics today and I posed myself the question: If a (schwarzschild but unimportant I think) black hole gains some mass m, how much does its volume increase? So I did that math and I got an equation. But then I began thinking, well when does the black hole actually gain the mass? Is it when the test particle reaches the singularity? Or is it when the particle crosses the event horizon? The latter, if true, is quite counterintuitive to me. The reason I say this is due to the nature of an event horizon, the region beyond it is really no different from the region outside except for the fact that your light cone is doomed to enter the singularity. Now let’s say we’re looking at a supermassive black hole (SMBH), and two stars outside of said supermassive black hole. Let’s say Star A is just a bit outside the SMBH and star B is slightly further out than star A. If we calculate the gravitational effect on star B, when star A is in between B and the SMBH, it makes sense that we would have to account for both gravitational effects (A and SMBH). Now let’s say star A is just beyond the event horizon. When star A is in between B and the Singularity, what do we do? How do we calculate for B? Do we add all of the mass from star A to the SMBH, when we just accounted for it before? I’m thinking that this is the case, but I’m having a hard time understanding why.

Constant acceleration to reach the speed of light?,1608184976,"Alright, so, I've been thinking about it for a while now and tried to inform myself as best as I could, but didn't find anything. The basic idea is that if you accelerate by expunging something in the opposite direction, then technically it should be possible to just keep accelerating until you reach the speed of light. 

**[Confusion 1]**


So let's say you have an acceleration of just 10 m/s² and let's say it's in the space between galaxies and moving towards a galaxy (so that gravity wells and friction are as little of an issue as possible).


From my limited understanding, in a total vacuum (I know that's space isn't *actual* true vacuum), no matter how fast you go, you should need the same amount of force to accelerate you, since the propellant moves at your speed and the expulsion slows it down while propelling you.


So assuming that c = 300,000,000 m/s, it should be reached in 347.22 days at a constant acceleration of 10m/s². But that's not how it works and I don't understand why exactly. The ""well, you would run out of fuel"" answer that I found sounds like a massive copout, since it avoids addressing the actual why. What makes it require infinite energy to keep accelerating, if what accelerates you is at 0 speed relative to you, thus always pushing you forward without things slowing you down. 

**[Confusion 2]**


Another thing confusing me is that speed it usually measured relative to something. So then acceleration to the speed of light is impossible *relatively* to some other object? I don't need the energy to accelerate to 720,015 km/h when running, despite the solar system moving at 720,000 km/h. I only need the energy to accelerate to 15 kilometers per hour, since I'm moving on earth. Meaning that if we had a sort of matryoshka system, where each object accelerates to 5% of the speed of light and is used as a platform for another object, the 20th object would reach 100% of the speed of light relative to their starting point...but at the same time still only move at 5% relative to the 19th one...And wouldn't that allow to go way past the speed of light?


**[Confusion 3]**


Photons travel at the speed of light. Two light beams hit each other, they are *not* colliding at twice the speed of light, why? The answer I found is ""Well, cause it's the infinite speed and infinity x2 is still infinity"". Which...sounds silly. Let's say we observe 2 stars from earth. Both are 5 light years away from us and at the exact opposite sides of Earth. The light reaching us isn't 10 years old, it's 5. So they closed the distance of 10 light years in 5 light years to meet on Earth's position. Meaning their combined speed was twice the speed of light. Meaning they collide at twice the speed of light. What am I missing?


I guess the answer after the ""well, it's infinity"" is that light doesn't have much of a mass. But what happens if two objects moving at let's say 51% of the speed of light collide? Are they colliding at 100%, despite having moved at 102%? Do the 2% just go poof? Are we starting to distort space to force us into losing impulse relatively to each other until we are at 100%?

An idea on measuring the speed of light,1608183058,"I'd like to start by pointing out that I have no background in physics but I will try my best to discuss this topic in the comments.  I recently saw [Veritasium's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k&amp;ab_channel=Veritasium) on why the one-way speed of light cant be measured, and at the end he touched on how it's theoretically possible for light to travel at different speeds depending on the direction, keeping us from knowing if C is actually a constant or an average.

This got me thinking, and I had an idea. If the issue with measuring the one-way speed of light is the inability to synchronize clocks without knowing the one-way speed of light, the next step is to instead attempt to prove that light travels at a constant rate.

First thing to do would be pick distant points to establish a frame of reference by which we can determine the direction light is travelling.

Then, launch a satellite into orbit around Earth that has synchronous rotation. This satellite should have a sensor or something on it and every time it completes a revolution, it should send a message. If each message is sent at the same distance from Earth and at the same point in the satellite's fixed rotation, the messages should arrive at equal intervals.  Synchronous rotation would be necessary to make sure every message travels in the same direction for each location of the Earth in its orbit (such as north, south, east, or west of the sun) Throughout the Earth's revolution around the sun, the direction the light travels, as determined by our previously established frame of reference, will change. If light travels at different speeds depending on direction, a pattern should emerge in the data.

For example, if it takes 24 hours for the satellite to rotate and revolve, and 5 minutes for the message to travel, then the first message would be received 5 minutes after being sent and each subsequent message would be received every 24 hours until the direction changes enough for the speed of light to increase or decrease, at which point the interval will increase or decrease by a nonzero amount before returning to 24 hour intervals until the speed of the message changes again. Over the course of a year there would be multiple points of data that indicate an increase or decrease in the speed of light, and put together they'd form a pattern mapping out the directions that light travels faster in. As more data is gathered over years, this pattern would remain and become more accurate. Or, conversely, a steady interval will be observed at all times, indicating that light travels at the same speed regardless of direction, and that C is in fact a constant.

Antimatter(?),1608182090,"
I don’t know if this is the appropriate place to ask this question, but I’ll spill some short context anyway:

I asked a pretty odd, possibly less intelligent question, if it’s possible for the earth to explode. The first thing I thought about was what will it take to explode the earth? And is this even possible? Wouldn’t gravity be an obstacle? I watched a video on Kurzgesagt on YouTube about nuking the moon, which somehow inspired this question. Unfortunately, I don’t have that (what I call: “gift”) of clearly articulating what I want to say, so if what I’m trying to express now doesn’t make sense, then yikes. Anyway, I brought this question to a group of people on an MBTI reddit chat and the topic of “antimatter” was brought up. I’m passionate about science and space, but certainly NOT the most informed. I know antimatter relates to physics...(does it?) what is antimatter? How is it relevant to my original answer? Is it relevant?

I’m sorry if the questions seems, for lack of better word, “dumb”. For context, I’m in my second year of high school only having studied biology, earth science, and chemistry.

Looking for answers on sliding weight vs lifting weight,1608147646,"Backstory:  I'm contesting a written warning that I was given at work.  We had roughly 450lbs/32ft of 2"" iron that needed to be moved back 18"".  A co-worker and myself were to stand over the iron, on at about 10ft and the other at about 20ft.  Once over the iron we were the crouch down and ""pull"" the section of iron from in front of us back towards our feet.  Company policy says that we cannot lift over 50lbs/person.

Outcome:  Co-worker suffered an injury due to trying to ""push the section of iron.""  I was in route to my area of the section with the thought that we would both be sliding it back and he took it upon himself to try and ""push"" the section back resulting in a bicep strain.

I could be wrong but this is what I think! Just a theory.,1608094391,"I think we haven't been around long enough to make correct bad assumptions about the universe. What if singularities are consuming us whole as we speak and much greater rates as they absorb mass, in essence ending Everything. The reason the universe is seemingly expanding, and the reason we're seeing strange blips, clouds, and reactions. Is because standard information isn't reaching us correctly. To clarify by example with light. As we approach the singularity at a greater velocity, the light in relative terms takes longer to get to us, and somewhat distorts how it is perceived. That potentially this process is reaching a critical point. We have no way of knowing what the state of the next galaxy is for billions of years what the state of the next galaxy is because the light emitted was done so far away and so long ago. This would explain shifts in starlight. Why some observations seem skewed and interesting. Its because relative information is reaching us slower. And the universe is collapsing. The illusion is cast by stars that potentially are in the same process of absorbtion right now. The reason we're seeing expansion is because that information is getting further away from us as we are from it. The light in-between plays a descriptive role.

Essentially the idea is that by proving a conditional predictable quantum tunneling situation. Essentially the basis of this idea is that light is casting the 4th dimension into our 3rd-dimensional world, and as it does this it updates our world. However, that would mean that if a particle could consistently move through a 3-dimensional barrier without being updated in the time it travels through that barrier you could sort of prove that our universe is something more like a high hertz computer rather than some fluid system. The idea for this experiment is to build a particle accelerator and then to accelerate an electron to a speed that is close enough to a resonating speed of light to which you could predict when the light would catch the electron or not on some measurable scale. Then you simply see if you could predictably tunnel the electron through a barrier.

On the graph in this video, spacetime is bent due to the mass of Earth. I noticed that this means the space coordinates are misaligned from the time coordinates, if you know what I mean. You can see this on the graph. From what I've gathered, this is why things fall.

As far as I know, this is because the deflection angle is proportional to the De Broglie wavelength, which in turn is inversely proportional to both mass and speed of the object.

So, as the object gets larger/heavier, its mass increases, the De Broglie wavelength decreases and the deflection angle decreases.

a guy suggested I post this thing here but if you know of a better place to put it let me know also if you can solve it you might be able to get a noble idk,1607926403," 

As far as I know there are two main universal theorys one is the multiple worlds theory ( there are several different worlds each with there own laws and physics) And the time split theory ( the one where every possible outcome down to the change in direction of an atom creates a separate branch of time) and also have my own theory a world can be created by a beings thought ( can be as simple as a dog wanting food and fantasizing about eating or as complex as some people's world building skills) this in turn makes more beings that make there own thought having the cycle continue but what if we wher to combine the two main universal theorys ( multiple worlds and time splitting)

Picture this there are several worlds as the multiple world theory states but every outcome in each of these separate worlds makes a different branch of time as the time splitting theory states to put more simply each of the multiple worlds are the seeds of a plant and each of the possible outcomes are the branches that grow out of the seed

So now here comes the math part of the question I doubt we could find out how many different worlds there are but we could figure out how many time splits there could be roughly for each world using a simple-at first-but-is-most-likely-going-to-need-a-lot-more-added-to-it formula of

The average lifespan of a universe × the number of possible times a variable could change in the universes life × average universe lifespan × changeable variables and well that would go on forever ( also I'm going to refer to the universes lifespan as UL and the amount of changeable variables as CV from here on

Now the only way that loop would break is if there comes a point where the universe ends before any variables could change on each and every branch fortunately there is that point and that would be the universes death and so our formula does have an end and it the UL × ( UL × CV )

Now, what's the Nobel part well if you can calculate ( or Google search if someone has already done it) when the universes would die and then calculate ( or Google) the number of times there could have been a variable change in the span of the universes life and plug them into the formula and the roadblock is us living thinking organisms.

Why are we a roadblock? Well simply put it's our sheer numbers and the fact that we are thinking individuals with our own choices to make meaning that every choice a thinking organisms makes down to whether or not to twitch our finger is a possible changeable variable and this applies to anything that moves or does anything on its own and this includes the most likely not so theoretical aliens on different planets even if there just micro organisms that can do stuff on there own

Fortunately, there is a way around this and it's the number made thanks to the poincaré recurrence theorem

If you don't know what that is well it's the theory that everything at some point will do a full loop return to the state it is in right now down to you reading this pointless mathematical monster and they calculated that it would happen in 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 10 to the 1.1 why am I not using a unit of time measurement well because it doesn't matter if you use seconds or millennia the number is so damm big it wouldn't even make a dent in how long it would take to put simply it's the mathematical equivalent of saying ""a time"" to the guy who just wants to know the time to see if he can his get lunch yet

And that big number I just said up there I suspect is very close to the CV and hazza I just gave you a hint on where to start this monstrosity of a mathematical equation Thanks for reading this short story of a question and let me know if you solve it and get a Nobel

TLDR: well if you have to read this I don't think you will be up to the challenge I just gave in it but the gist of it is that there is an equation that I a 17-year-old discovered while half asleep and was in post wake up philosophical mode that I remembered long enough to post on Reddit and I have no idea what sub to post it on so it is here and the equation itself is something Austin from game theory would make up if he had the time or the excuse to do it",Physics,someoneudontno1,False,/r/Physics/comments/kcs3ol/a_guy_suggested_i_post_this_thing_here_but_if_you/

What has me so interested in this is it's exactly how Einstein discovered relativity: by adding time as the 4th dimension. Of course in order to make the units homogeneous he had to solve for length so he used -ict(minkowski actually). So I was going to add energy in there because Bohm suggested there is a global hidden variable. Well, it turns out that when you solve energy for units of length it's the wavelength. So I came up with an equation for the energy of anything(particle, photon) and solved for wavelength.

Can use of Earth's resources on extraterrestrial projects impact orbit and gravity?,1607859934,"First of all, I am just a general public and apologies of the question is vague if not outright silly. But it bugs me and no one seems to be discussing this.

The hypothetical scenario. In the near future we start building more and more satellites, probes, and spacecrafts for space travel. Obviously, this material leaving the planet surely must affect the overall Earth's mass and gravity. Assuming if this goes uncontrolled for centuries, would not the loss of mass affect our orbit around the Sun? Or even our own rotation?

Furthermore, all the materials we now use for the hundreds of communication satellites in our orbit. I suppose, they are in our orbit so maybe it counts still as earth's mass in relation to other celestial bodies?...

Lastly, China had an excavation mission on the moon and are expecting 2 kg of lunar mineral to be brought back to earth.

suppose there are two frames of reference.lets say A and B (Cars) at rest.both start accelerating with acceleration q at time t=0.An observer in car B sees that wrt him car A is stationary(since both are moving at same accelaration)

and since the state/inertia of car A never changed wrt B,newtons 1st law is valid in his frame.

Why does US higher education focus so heavily on Quantum Mechanics?,1607725613,"I'm from UCLA and the number of classes devoted to QM vs other areas of Physics is not even a competition.

Here's number of compulsory classes devoted to some fields-

Special Relativity- 0 classes, taught with EM

Fluid/Contiumm Mechanics- 0 classes, lab elective

General Relativity- 0 classes, senior yr elective 

Quantum Mechanics- 4 mandatory classes, 3 of them upper division

That's the most of any field (closest being analytical mechanics with 2 mandatory classes) 

That's not all, if you so choose you can make your entire undergrad about QM if you willingly choose such classes (particle physics, QFT etc). Not possible to do this for other areas. It's like 70% of the university resources are devoted to the theory of the very small.

Theory/application of linear algebra techniques,1607722073,"This might be a stupid, weird, or difficult to understand question. It's been a while since my linear algebra classes, and my professor back then was never really big on theory. Also it’s mostly a math question, but I like the way physicists think so maybe I’ll get some helpful replies here too. 

You are analyzing 3 (ostensibly unrelated) 4x4 matrices. You find that the first matrix A has linearly independent column vectors 1 and 2. You find that second matrix B has linearly independent column vectors at 1 and 3. You find that the third matrix C rrefs to the identity matrix, completely linearly independent.

You furthermore find that the simple addition of A + B + C results in matrix D which also rrefs to the identity. 

My question is, is this to be expected of any three matrices? A and B do not span the space, but C does, so when C is added the result necessarily spans the same space. However, these three matrices are not necessarily describing the same vector space. Does reaching a result like this imply that they are all describing the same vector space?",Physics,ground__contro1,False,/r/Physics/comments/kbbqtx/theoryapplication_of_linear_algebra_techniques/

Help reconstructing device from my childhood - human centrifuge using garden tractor,1607720744,"Below is linked a video of the contraption. The sequence is rather short, but it should be enough to explain the question in pictures.  


My dad build something kind of similar. It was on an ice lake, a raft 'T' mounted in the ice. One arm of the 'T' much longer then the other. The adults would push the short arm around, and a kid would try to hang on in the long end.  


Then I saw the linked sequence, and I'm wondering how they got it working using rope. It looks like a few things has to be in balance. I guess the speed of the tractor is significant. And it's distance to the center and the 'flying' persons weight.  


Probably also the starting conditions. I imagine it will have to be a running start. Perhaps I have to make a table size experiment .  


On the tractor is a iron frame. I wonder what the significance is. Perhaps only mounting of the strings.  


I understand torque, forces, momentum, centrifugal force etc., but have a hard time imagining the correct conditions for sucess.  


I guess my question is, how do make the parameters balanced, so the system can work?

Black Hole's Physical Effects,1607709831,"Context; an idea I have for a magickal spell in my bok series.

Say a wizard can open a black hole the size of a golf ball through magick. The hole pops into existence instantly after a prolonged ritual, and lasts for about one second before disappearing along with anything it's ""eaten.""

What would happen to the area around it in that one second, and to what distance could the black hole affect things? Would this be a world ending apocalypse or something localized? My initial inclination is to think that everything in its sphere of influence is dramatically accelerated toward the event horizon and heats up to extreme degrees, while only stuff within a short distance would actually be ""eaten.""

A graph of all possible radioactive decay chains,1607702408,"This post is about [this](https://imgur.com/cQEpdro) image, which is a graph of every decay chain known to Wolfram Mathematica and how they connect to each other. It seems imgur wont let you zoom in on the image, so the only way to be able to see the detail I can think of is to download it and view it locally on your own computer (file size ~3 MB).

So I've been messing around with the data functions in Mathematica a bit and found them quite interesting, each function returns information about some domain of knowledge, for example the CountryData function returns information about countries. One that is interesting for physics reasons is the IsotopeData function. If we want to know the possible decay products of uranium-235 we can call it like so:

    In = IsotopeData[""Uranium235"",""DaughterNuclides""]
    Out = {Entity[""Isotope"", ""Thorium231""], Missing[""Variable""], Entity[""Isotope"", ""Mercury207""], Entity[""Isotope"", ""Lead210""], Entity[""Isotope"", ""Lead215""]}.  
The Missing[""Variable""] is a bit strange at first, but if we check out uranium-235's decay modes we see that it is a marker for the fact that uranium-235 can undergo spontaneous fission, and basically end up in many places:

    In = IsotopeData[""Uranium235"",""DecayModes""]
    Out = {""AlphaEmission"", ""SpontaneousFission"", ""Magnesium28ClusterEmission"", ""Neon25ClusterEmission"", ""Neon20ClusterEmission""}

In the [documentation](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/IsotopeData.html) of the IsotopeData function they make a graph of all elements reachable from [uranium-232](https://imgur.com/YEzy8Dc). Since you can reach some of the elements in that graph by other means (e.g. radium-222 can also decay into lead-208, but is not present here) I decided to see if I could make a graph of all possible radioactive decay chains and how they fit together. I will not include any spontaneous fission decays, since I don't really have a way of determining the decay products.  
After a bit of tinkering I created this code:

    GraphPlot[
      Flatten[
        ParallelMap[
          Function[a,
            a[[1]]\\[DirectedEdge] # &amp; /@a[[2]]
          ],
          Function[b,
            DeleteCases[
              DeleteCases[
                Select[b,Head[#[[1]]] == Entity &amp;],
                _Missing, {3}
              ],
            {a_, {}}, {1}]
          ][ParallelMap[{#, IsotopeData[#, ""DaughterNuclides""]} &amp;,
              IsotopeData[]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]
which responds with [this](https://imgur.com/T1DO4wA) very blobby and unreadable graph. You can see some things from it though: Most elements connect in some way with most other elements! There seems to be nine separate groups of elements that you can not go between, with most being tiny and one containing almost all isotopes known.

This is cool, but it is not really possible to explore the graph, and it does not contain any information about what vertex is what element. I don't think this is the optimal way of doing it, but I managed to create the following code replicates the previous graph, but in higher resolution and with every vertex marked with the corresponding elements symbol

      Function[decays, 
        Block[{names}, 
          names = ParallelMap[IsotopeData[#, ""Symbol""] &amp;,VertexList[decays]];
          GraphPlot[decays, ImageSize -&gt; 2*8640,
          VertexSize -&gt; Tiny, 
          VertexLabels -&gt; Thread[VertexList[decays] -&gt; names], 
          VertexLabelStyle -&gt; Directive[Black, 10], 
          EdgeShapeFunction -&gt; GraphElementData[{""Arrow"", ""ArrowSize"" -&gt; .0005}]
        ]
      ]
    ][Flatten[ParallelMap[
      Function[edge, edge[[1]] \[DirectedEdge] # &amp; /@ edge[[2]]], 
        Function[isotopes, 
          DeleteCases[
            DeleteCases[
              Select[isotopes, Head[#[[1]]] == Entity &amp;], _Missing, {3}], {a_, {}}, {1}
              ]
            ][ParallelMap[{#, IsotopeData[#, ""DaughterNuclides""]} &amp;, 
              IsotopeData[]
            ]
          ]
        ]
      ]
    ]

Which creates [this](https://imgur.com/cQEpdro) massive image! I don't think the detail is viewable on imgur, so to see any detail you have to download it and zoom in. Some detail from the ""head"" of the biggest structure can be seen in [this](https://imgur.com/FvX9k7a) image. We can see how e.g. barium-152 connects to the structure through a string of β- decays.  
Now we can figure out what those small islands are. The [largest of the small islands](https://imgur.com/40T8yMd) appears to be how you can get to helium-3, while the smallest one is just [neutron decay](https://imgur.com/NXuYnnR).

Cannot travel faster than the speed of light,1607644781,"The phrase often found in media ""You can't go faster than the speed of light"" is somewhat misleading to the layperson. Specifically, it would cause most laypeople to answer the following question incorrectly: ""Can a 20 year-old travel to a planet 300 light-years away before they turn 40?"".

The answer is that yes they can but because of time dilation more than 300 years will have passed in the rest frame.

If I were to design a speedometer for a spaceship that could go near light-speed I would probably have it display a ""ground speed"" that indicated the distance being traversed accounting for time-dilation. This ground speed concept would be more helpful for planning trips between star systems because it accurately predicts how long it will take the traveler to reach their destination. If they are at a ""ground speed"" of 3c it will take them 20 years to go 60 light-years. On the same gauge it would also display the amount of time-dilation occurring for that ground-speed. I think those two numbers are more useful together than a true speed. For example a speed of .9c would have a ground speed of 2.11c and a time-dilation of 2.35. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is there a better term for ""ground speed""?

I need some advice...,1607642330,"Hello, I am a 16 year old IGCSE CIE student.

I am currently in year 11, and I took triple award (higher) sciences. I plan to take Higher Physics and mathematics AA for IB, (and possibly chemistry depending on your advice).  


I recently fell in love with quantum physics and mechanics. As I approach the end of my secondary school career, I have to start thinking about what university to go to, what degree to take etc.

Whilst I have thought about engineering, I have firmly decided that quantum physics is my passion. Whilst I still do not know much, I am wondering, and quite frankly worrying about my future as a physicist.

So I will break this down to the bare essential:  
I would like to study quantum physics at a university in the US (Berkeley/MIT/Harvard).  
Money is not a problem, neither is my passage to the US.

What I worry about, is that I am unable to find what degree to apply for, to study quantum physics at a university.

Secondly: If I were to continue down this avenue of subatomic particles, what sciences are necessary for IB? As physics and mathematics AA are already occupying 2 of my spots for higher level, and I am not sure if it is necessary to take a second science at higher level for this sector.

I’m probably 99% wrong but hear me out.,1607634794,"I didn’t sleep last night and discovered quantum tunneling and quantum biology. So, I think I have a theory. I’m by no means a scientist, so please tell me if I’m wrong or if I’m onto something. Wrong or right, I don’t care. It’s just a hypothesis. 
Keep in mind, I was sleep deprived. 


“Quantum tunneling/entanglement/biology and the effect of phantom limb phenomena and the general perception of reality.”

Through quantum tunneling, electrons are able to pass through solid states of matter, typically achieved through lab experiments inside of vacuums and usually performed at absolute zero in order (in my theory) to mimic that of the  natural state of behavior of atomic and subatomic particles, considering that earth can’t possibly be the only place that these mechanisms of actions occur. 

Quantum tunneling is seen in some species of bacteria undergoing photosynthesis (quantum biology). 

Could feeling phantom sensations in a limb that is not, or is no longer connected to the body, (rubber hand experiment) imply that quantum entanglement and/or quantum tunneling are happening throughout the body as a whole, due to the brain’s methods of perception, the wiring of our central nervous system and exposure to what we “perceive” the world as, along with being perceived as such by the brain from outside rather than inside in it’s entirety and then fed to our five “senses” to create our perception of reality, as our brains are constantly making their best guesses at connecting the dots to create and provide an explanation of the world around us? (Consciousness and perception). 
Does this imply that perception itself isn’t actually provided and produced by the brain, but interpreted by the brain entirely through outside forces (electrical and magnetic pulses for example), and our brains shape the way we perceive anything and everything, via the connections it can make through quantum entanglement/tunneling, seeing as electrical impulses are what fuel our brains functions? (I think I’ve asked the same question twice. Fuck it).
But where is the antenna to pick up the quantum signal? 
That’s the real question.

Therefore, is TMS a merging of man and machine in the sense that quantum entanglement/tunneling can become “one” with the brain via electrical signals and magnetic pulses being transferred back and forth, thus causing a physical change in the body and mind, and our perception of reality along with any other electrical or magnetic machines such as an fMRI machine? Can our brains make an assumption of what is right or wrong, and correct or incorrect by being affected by electrical or magnetic interference with our natural systems that regulate the brain and our senses along with personal biases we’ve created through our memories, life experience and continued perception of what we deem as reality?
The brain runs on electrical impulses via the firing of neurons and we literally have to stay in tune with the earth’s natural magnetic frequency to maintain homeostasis. 
So, can machinery that picks up on brain “activity” interfere with our own perception of reality and shape the way that our brain interprets what is around us? 
Do we make personal connections through quantum tunneling/entanglement when it comes to shared interests, for example?

"At times, I wish I wasn't pursuing a physics degree...",1607611376,"Yeah...I'm starting to believe I could have taken another route. Last weekend, I was talking to this guy who studies English and Film in his 3rd year and we were talking about our subjects. He told me he had to write 10 essays this semester and yes I agree that's challenging. However, he also had 3 contact hours (online) per week and not as much reading as he thought he would get. 

I, on the other hand, had 4 lab writeups, which are very near to being reports at 2000 words on average, 2 mid-term exams, 2 coding tasks, 4 quick reports (honestly the compuing reports are chill), 3 quizzes, 1 short essay and this assignment about research and using LaTex.

I still have 2 presentations, 1 essay, 1 quiz (harder than it seems), 1 more assessment for computing and my 2 exams in January. Plus I have around 20 contact hours (again online) a week (thankfully this is the last week of teaching) and it's physically and mentally exhausting. I'm already behind as it is.

Sometimes, I don't feel I should have taken physics. I'm in my 2nd year now so there's no going back and I've already decided that I'm not dropping out. I wonder what position I would have been in if took a subject such as English. I have realised that I might be better with written assignments as a whole than exams. If I took a BA instead of a BSc, then I'd just have to read and write essays (there are exceptions, just generally). I don't know for sure if that's any easier but if the only type of assessment I get is writing essays, then I'd be so used to writing them to the point where I have a clear formula how to bang them out every time. They're fun to write when you know what you're doing. 

With maths and physics exams I feel so much more uncertain. You're either right or wrong. Yes you get marks for working out but with an essay there's more room to be creative I suppose. 

Maybe physics isn't the hardest degree. I don't think I'd manage a degree in health care such as medicine, dentistry or even nursing with the amount of work experience they must complete as well as uni. But I do wonder if I've made it unnecessarily hard for myself by choosing physics. I'm struggling to get a regular job now far more for an actual STEM based career after I graduate...

I guess I just have to remember why I chose physics in the first place, because of my fascination with natural science and love of finding solutions to the end of writing beautiful equations...

I'd be happy to leave uni with a 2:1 but I'm trying to go for that 1st (honours if you're not from the UK). It's just that honestly my grades feel all over the place (although at the moment I'm averaging a 2:1 I think). I just want this year to end.

Just thought people here may be interested to ask questions, whether about physics, life as a researcher, or whatever other related questions you can come up with!

We will answer everything that gets posted, but there may be some delays after the first few hours due to us all having meetings etc, but we will get to all questions!

I hope everyone is doing well and staying safe!

Quantum Eraser Varient and FTL communication,1607472177,"Hello friends, I need help explaining to a colleague why the following experiment would not give FTL communication:

&amp;#x200B;

First start by having a laser go into a double slit. on each slit have a BBO crystal so that the photon is converted into 2 entangled pairs. Send the entangled pairs to two different systems. In the first system, use a prism to get rid of the ""which slit"" information, then send it to a photon detector.

on the second path, use a prism to get rid of the which slit information, then send it to a detector.

&amp;#x200B;

The kick is that now imagine we have our laser running, and the first and second observer are getting a continuous stream of photons. they should each see an interference pattern. Now, the first observer chooses to remove the prism, this allows the photon to go to one of two detectors that give the which slit information, since this is known, then observer two should have the interference pattern disappear for them. 

Now, the first observer can use this to send information in binary to the second observer faster than light.

(Question) Electrical potential difference and electrical potential.,1607451593,"*I'm a highschool freshman with a weak knowledge about energy and work! So take it easy on me.*

I understand that electrical potential is **amount of work to move 1 coulomb** in a certain point in cricuit. The wikipedia definition which by far is my favorite way to understand this:

&gt;An electrical potential is the amount of [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)) needed to move a unit of [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field without producing an acceleration.  

Now, electrical potential difference. I understand this as the **amount of work to move 1 coulomb between two points**. The wikipedia definition for this one is quite similar to the previous:

&gt;Electric potential difference is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points

And to calculate this you literally to what the name suggest, take the difference of the electric potential difference of both points.

Quantum Entanglement Question,1607451366,"So I just have a question about how quantum entanglement works because I've heard conflicting opinions regarding it. I'm no math wizz so I only have a fairly limited idea of the concept, but here goes: 

1. ""Spin"" is an intrinsic property all particles have that describes the physical behavior of that particle 
2. Entanglement is the process where two particles become 'tied' together, whereas manipulating the spin of one particle instantaneously effects the spin of the other quantumly entangled particle completely regardless of distance between those two particles 

If that's all somewhat accurate then basically this is all pretty amazingly puzzling because in some way 'information' is traveling far beyond the speed of light. But i've also heard nothing is really traveling anywhere and quantum entanglement isn't really amazing at all because its more like taking two boxes, one with a red ball inside and one with a blue ball inside and taking them very far away and then opening one, seeing you have the red ball and instantly knowing the other must have the blue ball. This makes the whole concept sound pretty lackluster, though I have no idea which is a more accurate way of describing quantum entanglement and why? Can you manipulate the spin of a quantum entangled particle and instantly effect the spin of the other regardless of distance, or is that also not how it works?

"What is the ""physically real"" representation of a sound wave?",1607445155,"In its ""purest"" form a periodic\* sound wave can be a sine wave which is only a fundamental without any further harmonics. It is a sine wave on a time/amplitude graph and only has one frequency on a frequency/amplitude graph.

Most periodic sound waves however are ""complex"" (a sawtooth wave for example) which means they are a ""combination"" of many different sine waves, i.e. frequencies in the frequency/amplitude diagram. However, every sound wave, no matter how complex, can still be fully represented on a time/amplitude diagram.

It seems weird to me that a complex mix of ""separate"" frequencies can still be represented on a time/amplitude scale which, at a given point in time, only has one dimension: the amplitude. I feel like if it can, this implies that there really is no such thing as ""different frequencies at the same time"". There is really just one sound wave after all. Also, if we look at how a speaker works, it is basically exactly how the time/amplitude looks. It only needs to move its membrane over time according to the specified amplitude. It is ""unaware"" of the frequency distribution. Similarly, a sound file (e.g. WAV) of a given quality, always has the same file size per second, no matter how complex the sound. Even though looking at the frequency diagram would give you the impression that a complex sound wave contains a way higher amount of ""information"" that must be saved.

Does it therefore make sense to say the time/amplitude graph is really the ""faithful"" representation of physical reality? While a frequency diagram is more of an analytical tool to better understand the nature of a certain sound wave? I am aware that both representations are mathematically equivalent by the means of a Fourier Transform, so this might be somewhat of a philosophical question. :-D

How is the angular momentum of large bodies related to that of fundamental particles?,1607420466,"Been thinking about angular momentum recently, and I have a few questions:

1. I have always assumed that, in Newtonian mechanics, angular momentum is just an emergent property of the linear momenta of the various particles comprising an object combined with the attractive forces that prevent those particles from flying off in the directions of their momenta. Is this true?
2. If (1) is true, then do the angular momenta of the fundamental particles comprising an object contribute to its overall angular momentum? If so, this implies that the two quantities are related somehow, but since the former is an intrinsic property of point particles, while the latter is an emergent property of linear momenta, it's not obvious to me how they are related.",Physics,beforevirtue,False,/r/Physics/comments/k91dyo/how_is_the_angular_momentum_of_large_bodies/

How could it be otherwise, so if two wave functions meet and become entangled they are just following causality at its basic definition. When it comes to wether something quantum is a particle or a wave, if its so that when two waves meet they entangle and make an interference pattern on the wall, then why couldn’t it be so that when you measure it it collapses into just one location, because of causality? You and the particle must be causally linked(because you observed), and for this reason it acts as a particle. Not for the reason that it acts as a wave when you are not observing, or measuring it. Because When its in that state, its just moving through space/time without being causally linked with anything(or for example, being linked with less) 1 or more times. So it can be said like this, when its acting as a wave there is nothing to add to the function, and when it reveals itself as a particle then there is nothing to subtract because the particle is at its highest potential when we observe it, so the highest potentiality of a wave being perceived by us, is its state as a particle.

Discussion : TENET (2020) - Gravity problem,1607374457,"Warning - SPOILERS (MILD)

Yesterday I watched Tenet (2020, by Christopher Nolan). The principle used in this espionage thriller is time travel through inversion of entropy (As you all know by now). Halfway through the film, the protagonist is inverted for the first time  (i.e. his entropy is reversed so he can travel back in time from that point) and is briefed by his fellow colonel on what to do and what not to do. There are all kinds of warnings;

(I don't remember exactly but can name few important ones)

- Wind flow will be reversed.
- Friction will be operating in opposite direction.
- If you come in contact with your past self, you both will annihilate.
- Heat flow will be reversed (fire will feel cold and ice will burn, as an exothermic reaction moving forward in time is an endothermic one when moving backward).

By that logic,

Gravitational force is attractive in nature when moving forward in time, and it should be repulsive otherwise;

and as the inverted person is able to feel all kind of reverse phenomenon easily (heat flow, wind flow, friction), he/she should be able to feel this too.

And yet they (inverted persons) are all walking normally, driving normal (non-inverted) cars, helicopters etc normally throughout the film.

I mean if Mr. Nolan includes reversed heat flow, reversed friction, reversed wind flow in the film; how can he skip such a basic thing like gravity. Unless I'm missing something ...

That's why I thought I should discuss this here.

I'm a first year student in physics in Germany, and I find it difficult to understand how I should study.

so first of all about me I am 25 years old and I've finished school long time ago when i was 18, In school it self I got average 80 in the tests, so I wasn't the best pupil.. in the half a year before starting my bachelor I've self learned basically all of the mathematics that one should know in order to start physics, but that was with the help of a really well structured online course (but it went really well).

right now after a bit more then one month into the University i started fail in every class which are:

* physics 1 
* analysis 
* linear algebra
* mathematical fundamentals(half semester course).

we have to turn in an assignment every week in each subject and lately I'm not able to even solve the questions.

my problems are two (that I know of)

2. is that I don't know how to handle the huge gap between the lectures and the assignments 

the lectures are literally only theoretical material and the explain nothing, and I don't know how to deeply understand how I should solve an assignment based on the lectures materiel

Due to movement in time field it creates time particles and the time particles make the object move forward in time. if u ask about still objects, you shouldn't forget that it has atoms which has electrons in a orbit. so its moving. talking about antimatter, we should not forget its just opposite of matter, but it still has positrons revolving around it.

The time particles have a speed. if we exceed the speed, then time slow downs. this explains time dilation.

Dry ice: why does it present a greater risk of frostbite than water ice if both were similar masses at the same temperature?,1607293561,"I can think of only three reasons:

1. CO2 ice is denser than water ice, so a chunk of similar size will actually be a greater mass and therefore be able to absorb more heat than an an identical volume of water ice.

2. Perhaps dry ice conducts heat faster than water ice, making it harder for the skin in contact with it to conduct heat to the flesh in contact with the ice.

3. Dry ice sublimates, so any skin in contact with it is in direct contact with the ice, while water ice will melt and form a very thin layer of cold water between the skin and the ice.  This seems to me to be a fairly weak protection unless the ice in question is *very* cold, since the layer of water will be very thin and, unless the ice is very cold, not much warmer than the ice.

I've read warnings not to ever ingest dry ice because of this, and can't quite puzzle it out.

**THE LAW OF CONSUMPTION**

**Understanding The Nature Of This World**

***By Shane Fiorentino***

This world is an enigma. I’m sure that Sheldon from *The Big Bang Theory* would attest to this statement. You’re alive! Yet, you were not before. And soon, it will be like you were never born. Very anti-climactic, but the truth is…you are now and you “will have been” later. You will leave behind something. For someone. That is not you. You will dream about what you want or what you wanted to have had in this life for the rest of your life. This is certain. Some of us will achieve some of our dreams, others will fail. Just like The Rolling Stones told us fifty years ago, *You Can’t Always Get What You Want*.

Why though, is this life not a conglomerate of all our fantasies? In a way, it is, if our fantasies are an extension of our identity, but I will get into that much later in a different transcript. But why do they not all come true? You could say it comes down to merit. Earning your future. Or luck. Or karma. I think I have a better theory to explain it.

We dream it rather than live it to alleviate our dissatisfaction with our current situation. If we cannot bring our fantasies to life, why should we expect anyone else to? In other words, we want it too much. We want it so much, that we become consumed with our desire for it and not with the work that needs to be done to make it happen.

I am going to give you a simple and shallow analogy to illustrate this. A gentleman named Jerry was hungry one afternoon and was craving a favorite meal of his. A medium Filet Mignon with some sea scallops, a baked potato and some cheddar topped broccoli. A delicious feast on his mind, he goes to the local Walmart to get everything. He comes home, cooks it, and as he is sitting down to eat realizes he forgot the sour cream! In a frenzy, he rushes back to the supermarket to get the precious finisher of the potato. All that is on his mind is this meal. He comes home, and his plate is empty! And in the corner of the room is his dog Snowball, still eating through the potato skin! Of course, he goes nuts on his dog, but the damage is done.

The moral of the story? If Jerry had been attentive of his situation before leaving his plate, he would have seen Snowball eyeing up his food. He may have wanted that meal, but so did Snowball. He needed sour cream to perfect his dish, and since Jerry was acting out his desires through emotions rather than planning his steps, he failed to get what he wanted. You could even argue that he should have had sour cream on his shopping list.

What am I getting at here? Why is the title of my thesis making such a braggadocious claim as a Law? When I say the Law of Consumption, I am making a claim that puts it to the level of the Law of Gravity. In fact, later toward the end, I will make a case for the Law of Consumption to overshadow Gravity. The devil of my theory is in the details, but if you allow me to, I would like to explain the universe by the strongest force that keeps it alive. Consumption.

***All Living Things Consume***

Play along with my dialogue here. It is Monday. You decide on this day you have achieved perfection. *Crazy ass you*. Because you are now perfect, you no longer need anything. You decide you do not need any food or water. Before next Monday, you will be dead. Along the way, your body will begin breaking down in an attempt to keep you alive, protecting your vital organs by feeding off the rest of your body.

Very grim example. Notice how because you stopped consuming, your body began to consume itself to keep its most precious parts alive. This is because your body naturally follows priorities in maintaining itself. It can only work with what it has been given. 

We have all studied food chains. Ecosystems and habitats. The strongest survive; ironically, so do the weakest. If the weakest died, then there would be nothing for the strongest to consume. This is why in the ocean there are millions of more plankton and other smaller organisms than there are sharks and whales. There is a balance. If there were as many sharks as there were plankton, the whole system would be out of whack. There can only be so many at the top of the chain.

So, the weak survive by numbers. The strong survive with quality over quantity. But the tides of humanity seem to be tipping more toward weak rather than strong, which NEVER LASTS. Sadly, even with large numbers, because of the over connectivity we all share because of the internet we feel alone in these numbers. As humanity becomes more dependent upon its extremely complicated systems that this new age has put into place, it will inevitably grow to make each individual weaker than its parents were. This weakness will effect survivability of “humanity”.

It is a shocker! I know. I think all of humanity understands we all eat. And most of humanity understands everything that is alive eats. Yet, you consume more than just food and water. Bacteria eat molecules and other microscopic stuff, and other cells eat them, all the way up the chain. Fungus eats itself; plants eat sunlight and sometimes flies. Everything eats? Why? If you don’t eat something, you will eat yourself! Just like the fungus, or your body on day four of your insane decision to no longer eat food. You must consume! If you don’t consume that which is outside, you will consume that which is inside.

There is more to this than just food and water though. Human beings need something to do besides basic survival or they will go insane. Life is supposed to be fun for us, so we need to consume a source of pleasure. If not, we will consume our own internal joys, hopes, and dreams and live in a fantasy until we die. We will literally devour our own happiness until we are miserable if we do not find joy outside of ourselves.

***All Non-Living Things Consume Space***

Gravity is the Law of Consumption at play within large bodies of mass. The ironic thing is that the smallest unit of stable mass, the atom which ironically is barely stable, also behaves the same way. The consumption of electrons are also the building block to how molecules form by consuming electrons from other atoms. Smaller particles revolve around larger particles in the nucleus. Electron fields desire to be filled if they are not. Every molecule is built in this fashion.

Rocks and other inanimate objects that appear to not consume anything do consume something. Space. Void. At its root level, everything that is made of mass takes up or consumes space. If mass moves, it is preoccupying a different space. Moving back to large bodies of mass and gravity now, these things want to consume more mass in order to take up more space because large bodies of mass are greedy in consumption by their nature. In the opposite way that atoms are greedy with energy, and I would argue light is the purest form of energy in that it is the physical manifestation of energy and does have the lightest mass possible at the fastest speed possible.

Stars are the 2nd most brilliant thing to consider when taking into account the law of consumption. They are self-consuming and most definitely want to consume more mass as they suck planets in towards them. They break everything down to helium or hydrogen, the base atoms of matter, until they dissipate the atoms into particles. I firmly believe light is just pure energy materialized, and that once you break down matter past the ability for it to take up a permanent space, you turn mass into light. Light then immediately travels at the maximum speed achievable which only it can achieve and never stops going until it is absorbed by that which can use its energy.

Light could be the core of stars itself, but I am highly doubtful of this idea. In fact, this is where my theory gets…as dark as you can get really…

If you trap a not yet determined amount of light into the same space, forcing photons together into the exact same space and contain it there, a black hole will appear. If light has nowhere to go at the fastest known speed, it begins. To consume. At the strongest known force.

***Consumption Materialized***

Light is pure energy. It must exist in that form. Traveling at the speed of pure energy, mass made so insignificant in its own mass that it just never ceases moving until it is absorbed. If light begins to absorb itself because it has nowhere to go, it begins to fade into itself.

At the center of stars lies the most condensed forms of matter imaginable. Once their greed for mass gets the best of them, that they force the light they create into their center at a undetermined rate, the light begins to have a gravitational pull. It then becomes the opposite of light. It becomes pure darkness, anti-matter, or….

A Black Hole- a body of space with a gravitational pull that wishes to consume all matter within its reach to bring it to a centralized point equal to the size of a photon. It’s gravitational pull is equal to that of the speed of light.

Since light is materialized energy that simply wants to give itself away, a black hole is materialized consumption, or gravity, that wants to devour everything to make it into nothing. There is no mass to a black hole, no actual physical tangibility. It is just simply pure gravity. I believe gravity in this purest form may allow light that is traveling roughly one-third to one-fourth within its event horizon but not toward its center to escape, but the closer to the center the light is traveling, the higher the odds the light will be consumed by the black hole. If a black hole’s gravitational pull is equal to the speed of light, the above theory is true. I do not think it is possible for anything to achieve a force beyond the speed of light, so a black hole’s force may be just a couple meters per second off, or as said above, exactly equal. At least we have an idea of how black holes work and are formed though. Light trapped so much so that it turns into mass of pure consumption.

***If Man Makes A Blackhole***

I don’t believe it is possible for man to make a blackhole, even using a combination of computer technology and the above theories I have poured out. If we ever do make a black hole, because we are not quite sure of its nature and how it would affect the gravitational balance of gravitational masses around us, we have to be wise in where we first make it in order to study it.

Why would we make one? To destroy an enemy nation would be the absolute dumbest thing imaginable so to use it for war is COMPLETELY OUT OF THE QUESTION. A tool of war should probably leave something left behind for the victor to claim, annihilating something to not be re-usable is just plain stupid and asinine. \*Cough, U.S. government WWII, Cough\*

If we could discover a safe space to house a black hole, or find one nearby that we could build around, without it being detrimental to Earth or the solar system, we could use it as an endless energy source if we harnessed its consumptional pull. Basically, use the black hole’s force outside of itself. How we could do that is beyond my understanding without having the damn thing to observe with my own eyes. I’m sure we could provide an endless energy to every single person with enough trial and error.

***Theory Further Exposited***

There is nothing faster than light and I would dare say its mass is proportionate to its speed. The mass of light is ironically, the lightest form of mass. But it is unstable in that it refuses to take up space. It moves so quickly it is never really in a space, or seemingly. Even with the most advanced technology achievable.

When light enters a medium that allows it to be, lets say consumed for the sake of the Law of Consumption, it still moves at a rate of its unmatchable speed until it is fully consumed by the medium. Electricity is light bound within a more tangible mass, as metals are conductors meaning they transfer what they consume from end to end. This of course explains the positive negative balance of electric systems. Our nerves use light. Our electrical wires use light. Its all light. Electricity is a form of light bound within mass instead of space. Attesting to the small nature of photons.

So if a yet to be determined amount of light is forced to NOT MOVE, its natural energy of moving at a rate of 299,792,458 meters per second doesn’t just disappear. It is forced to take up space, which light NEVER WANTS TO DO. And in that space its energy is forced to radiate outside of itself as it consumes itself into gravity. Pure gravity.

According to current scientific observation, this happens when stars finally give in. I assume the core of stars is so dense light almost does not escape, but it does. Or at the center of every star is a black hole filled with so much light that some escapes and some does not. I cannot really give an honest answer. All I can attest to is that black holes exist and are spawned by the most natural form of light there is. Stars. Light seems to be the only form of matter that does not want to consume! It is so light in fact, that it wants to be consumed by any physical medium other than itself and travels at the fastest speed possible in order to do so.

If light is forced to be in the same space, its energy is turned into pure gravity. Gravity at the force of light. Sounds absolutely terrifying.

Back to just general consumption principles, space or what some call nothing (nothing does not exist) desires to be filled but does NOT WISH to consume. It simply wants to not be empty because space is empty if not filled. Matter on the other hand wants to consume space because matter simply consumes. Space, other matter, sometimes light, even vibrations and other forms of energy. It is all consumed by that which consumes. 

***Water***

Water is amazing. It has a perfect molecular structure. In the sense that once hydrogen and oxygen fuse they are perfect. They don’t want to un-fuse nor fuse with anything else by any tendency. Water defines buoyancy, and is so resilient when it is turned into a solid it expands to maintain its molecular structure rather than condenses. It provides a habitat for just as many creatures or maybe even more than land and oxygen do. And….It allows light to flow straight through it like glass. You have to reach extremely low depths in the ocean for light to not reach you. Water has a perfect PH level meaning it is perfectly balanced in how it comes into contact with everything around it. Think of water as space physically manifested. You cannot breathe it, you will drown. But besides that, and sharks, water doesn’t really provide any negatives and is fundamental to all of life. 

The thing that baffles me most about water is that it of course follows the Law of Consumption in that it consumes space. But it also kind of doesn’t?

Because water flows and immediately gives into any other mass that enters it, water consumes a space but at the same time does not prevent any other mass from consuming that space. It immediately gives way. The principle element of water is most certainly flow. It does not resist contact with anything, but it most certainly does resist binding itself to anything on a molecular level. It is bind-proof, but also free to enter. It does not resist force, but fully absorbs it. That old saying of “Be water, my friend” is quite seriously good advice. Water acts like space itself. It gives way for the largest living beings to exist. I would argue the balance our planet maintains with more water than land is necessary for our atmosphere to be habituated. On a planet like Mars, life is not sustainable due to no presence of liquid water, natural surroundings or atmosphere. Our atmosphere is most certainly impossible without the aid of our massive oceans. We should not be treating them like we do. Water is the “blood” of Earth and land is the body. We pollute the blood of our planet too much and it can get sick. It can force a change in weather if it needs to in order to “fix” the problem. Like an immune system response.

***Trapping Light in Mediums***

Trapping light in mediums is not an answer to the supposed theory of black holes because that light is consumed within the medium. Mediums are taking up space before the light and after the light is trapped within it. Light gets trapped within mediums every millisecond all over the place. Its not a special phenomenon. You can watch light get trapped within crystals and glass contraptions right now on Youtube. Light trapped in matter and light trapped in space are two exactly opposite different things. Light wants to be consumed by matter and quite often is. Light does not want to consume space, it wants to defy space and be consumed by matter. Light is the most consumed thing. It never wants to consume itself.

Your skin itself absorbs light and is quite good for it too. Sunlight provides many healthy functions to the human body. There are many people who cannot absorb sunlight well and others who literally live inside their homes like vampires. You can notice a glow in someone’s skin when they absorb a healthy and moderate amount of light on a weekly basis. No matter the skin color, for those who wish to politicize everything they can get their eyes and ears on.

I find it near impossible with our current technology to figure out how to trap light in an empty space the size of a photon. Using mediums does not work due to the light needing to consume itself to start the black hole effect, it cannot be consumed by mass. We would need to use instruments that have mass in order to contain the light though. Maybe a little tiny space the size of a photon, but again, the mass around this would absorb light because it is impossible to prevent mass from letting light penetrate it to some degree.

Stars are a medium that light is trapped within. At its core could be pure light trying to escape from endless fusion of hydrogen and helium and other core elemental gasses around it. Maybe there is some certain resistant level that a star’s gravity must maintain in order for its gravity to not completely consume itself, and on the other end if the gravity becomes too weak the whole star just unleashes in a supernova?

After thinking about it, maybe using hyper condensed water is the answer to trapping light in space. Water so dense in its pressure light cannot get through the water. That does not make sense though. Water pressure comes from larger amounts of water, and water is the only thing that can add pressure to itself. Maybe finding a way to pressure water on one side while suspending it somehow with some manmade gravitational field? Im literally throwing out guesses.

***Endnotes***

Everything consumes. Nothing gives. This is The Law of Consumption. It is unavoidable. To say that you do not consume is to give way for you to be consumed because you do not care about being consumed. So you make yourself nothing. Becoming too greedy in your consumption will come back to hurt you just as much. Moderation is key. Too much of anything in your diet, in your habits, in your life balance is unhealthy and detrimental. Though that balance is something you yourself have to find and keep up with as you age because it will change over time. The planet we live on is treated as something that is disposable today and this is a danger of serious proportions the longer we wait to address it. The planet consumes what we give it, and eventually it will give it back to us. Consumption and the flow of nature most certainly work hand in hand. You reap what you sew, so you are what you eat.

Light is the ultimate example of mass giving itself away. One could say that “Mass consumes, energy gives” as energy is mass converted into a consumable form. The farther you break down the mass, the more digestible it is. This is why you chew Filet Mignon before you give it to your stomach, whether you are Jerry or Snowball. Light has no mass, inherently, as it is pure energy. A photon is not even a lot of energy, its just that where one photon comes from, beyond quintillions follow. Light cannot be stopped, it will be absorbed. It is its natural purpose. Black holes form when light is forced to take up the same space rather than outpace space itself. If this happens, if light is forced to become its own mass, it begins pulling things as its energy is turned into gravity. Gravity with the force of 299,792,458 meters per second inward rather than outward is pure gravity. Because light that enters a black hole is consumed by the black hole, it simply gives up the second it cannot get out because it is dealing with gravity equal to its own speed. It also wants to be consumed naturally, but it sadly will just join in being consumed by itself. 

The one thing I fear of black holes is this. Do they grow in size? If they DO NOT GROW in size, we can utilize black holes in the future as an endless energy source. If they DO, we cannot play with them. My theory is that they do not grow in size because they simply convert everything they consume into photon sized particles. If anything, they shrink as they further collapse into themselves.

Keynotes: Light is energy physically manifested in its purest form. A black hole is gravity physically manifested at the force of light, gravity in its purest form. Gravity exists because all of mass consumes space, and large bodies of mass consume more space. Water is the weirdest form of mass because it acts like space while remaining as mass and does not consume but coexists with other forms of mass. Mass consumes space, space gives way to mass, and time is the constant of change within this. Light wants to be consumed yet is the line at which mass is no longer mass. It is the mass-based exception of the Law of Consumption. A Black Hole wants to consume yet it is nothing but empty space that was once light self-consumed. It breaks everything it consumes down into light until the light fades away just as the first light did that formed it. It is the space-based exception to the Law of Consumption. Space is typically the first thing mass consumes, yet black holes defy this in the same way that light defies taking up space. All in all, mankind needs to start taking the space he lives in and the mass he lives on seriously.

After putting further thought into the nature of “gravity physically manifested”, its important to realize that there is a huge blessing related to the curse of unending spiral into gravity. At the core of our galaxy lies a supermassive black hole that is around 20,000 light years away. The problem with that is that black holes pull everything in at the rate of C, roughly. Light cannot exist within a black hole and neither can anything else, everything is just broken down into the black hole’s pure consumption. If it wasn’t for this black hole, we would not be alive. If it wasn’t for the sun we have that wants to consume earth with its gravity, we wouldn’t have the light we have. The systems that eat us alive in our modern world provide us with a ever revolving system that gives us opportunities. 

My next philosophy will be of how I believe light defines time itself. Because time is how we measure events that happen within physics, and nothing moves faster than the thing that allows us to see all things. Which is light. Light is therefore, the speed of time.",Physics,ShaneTino,False,/r/Physics/comments/k7xdjw/the_scientific_law_of_consumption/

Why size might not matter in physics...,1607247235,"I have a question for r/Physics. Apologies for the length but it’s a hard question to ask...

I was watching a Kurzgesagt video on the size of life. I've always found it interesting why size matters (hehe). Essentially size matters because force acts differently depending on the distance. The closer two bits of matter are, the stronger the force is between them. Everyone talks about electromagnetism being really strong compared to gravity which is obviously very strange.

Symmetry is very important in mathematics and so why is the standard model of particle physics asymmetric? Why is there beautiful symmetry between all the quarks and laptops and gauge bosons and yet the Higgs just seems to be slapped on there as an afterthought? Another thing that has always interested me is why the laws of nature are the way they are.

I love the idea that we are only conscious because in an infinite universe everything that can happen will happen. And then with multiverse theory, the laws of nature can be different and so with an infinite multiverse all the laws of nature that can happen will happen. So if it is possible to ask the question “why?” then there will exist a universe where the laws of nature are as such to allow for the evolution of life and intelligence to such a state where it can reflect on existence and ask why. The age-old something verses nothing debate. But what if it was simpler than that.

What if there was only one possible perfectly symmetrical configuration of the natural laws. This, therefore, would not only be a grand unified theory of our universe but a grand unified theory of every universe if others exist.

The reason there is stuff in the universe is more to do with the interaction between the two branches of physics, quantum mechanics and general relativity, than it is to do with the inner workings of each branch. After all, without gravity, all we would have had 13 billion years after the big bang is just shit loads of hydrogen and without quantum mechanics maybe the big bang wouldn’t have happened at all.

We have been able to study quantum mechanics in great detail because we have been able to smash together really small things at high energies and watch what happens. The only time (correct me if I’m wrong) we have ever been able to smash together two really big things was when we measured gravitational waves. What if we could smash together black holes or even quasars at will as we do with protons at the LHC? Maybe it is only then that we would uncover the true complexity of the underlying makeup of general relativity. And perhaps that would hold the solution to dark energy and dark matter which are again in the category of the physics of the very big.

Also, am I right in saying that at high enough energies all the particles sort of combine into one? Sorry,  I am not a physicist, merely a philosopher. But if the Weak force and the Electromagnetic force combine into one at high enough energies and matter and energy is all essentially the same thing then aren’t we just talking about one thing. So theoretically if the Higgs boson, dark matter and dark energy are just variations of one thing essentially all of physics is just a perfectly symmetrical interaction between two things.

So going back to my original pondering of why does physics “seem” asymmetrical in reality it’s not. It’s just because we humans are on the “nearer to quantum” side of things so that shit is easier to observe. If we were “nearer the gravity” side of things we might have discovered relativity before we discovered the atom. We might have 16 gravity-related particles and multiple gravity equations explaining the Higgs and dark energy and dark matter instead of just one and one equation. And then we’d be staring at this weird “quantum” particle and wondering how it fits in with everything. (or maybe those people actually exist but they are just too big for us to even comprehend let alone communicate with?!)

The most important implication of this would be that once again size wouldn’t matter. All that would matter is the ratio of how “close” you were to the quantum side of things relative to the gravity side of things. Maybe none of this makes sense and I’m just doing that stupid thing that the quantum quacks do when they say that they are connected to everyone because of “entanglement”.

Idea for testing if speed of light is the same in opposite directions,1607223512,"So I just finished watching Veritasium's video about how [The Speed of Light\* Can't Be Measured](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k), and I think I came up with a way of testing if light travels at the same speed in opposite directions:

Let's say there are 2 points, A and B, and there are 2 setups for measuring the time it takes for light to travel between them:

1. The clocks are both synchronized at point A, and one of the clocks is then moved to point B.

2. The clocks are both synchronized at point B, and one of the clocks is then moved to point A.

If light goes from point A to B for both tests, and when it passes by a clock it stops its timer, then if the speed of light is the same in both directions, the difference in the time measured by each clock should be the same for both tests, and different if not the same.

This depends on time dilation depending on the speed of light, which Derek says at around the 10:40 mark. I'm honestly not too sure about this so would be glad to hear why it would or wouldn't work from someone that actually knows about this stuff.

 In my head I see it as this. If you imagine a very large aquarium. And within that Aquarium you see it as if it is a sort of  mist there. Now if you look from the outside of the aquarium it seems like this mist is constantly moving, but what it actually is, is that each of every single particle of mist is like shaking or vibrating. The mist in my head represents space and the shaking and vibrating represents time. So that is space-time. Now we come to the tricky part cuz in my head the vibration is caused by energy that causes time to happen. It's like putting every single particle within a constant change. And if you would just have the mist and nothing else there then the Mist would be evenly spaced between each other and time would be flowing the same way all over.

 Now we come to matter. Matter in my head is a collection of energy as I understand it in its most basic form.  So to represent this within my imagined image matter would be seen as if the mist got compressed. It would be compressed by all sides at the same time so it would look like a sort of ball. So you have this Mist let's make it  light grayish. And within this light grayish mist, you have darker spots like balls hanging in the air, and these then would be matter. Now I've Been Told whenever I see like  a lesson in physics, or like a physics documentary that gravity is a warping of space-time. So then within my light grayish mist there is balls of matter and these balls warp space-time around them making it seem as if the Mist is being drawn in towards the center of the ball. But in fact it is not. For what it really is, is that the Mist is being compressed. So the closer you get to the center point of this ball the more compacted the mist becomes, and because the Mist is constantly moving you would perceive it as if it was moving towards the center of the ball. And this also explains to me the way I see it. How time slows down the higher the gravity is. Because higher gravity just means a higher compression of these mist, and since time is represented in the vibrations of this Mist particles. Then the more you compress them the less they can vibrate. So sort of becoming. If you take the example off water vapor becoming liquid water, then becoming ice. Because ice is highly compacted because the particles within it has low energy count making the water molecule vibrating less.

 So now within my mental image. There is an aquarium with a light grayish Mist within it. Within this light grayish mist there are densely compacted regions that are perceived as balls because the light grayish mist is being compacted because of gravity. And what is seen as gravity is just Energy being compacted in the form of matter. Since matter is more highly dense then what normal space-time is. And the slowing of time it's just that these Mist particles cannot vibrate as much ask those Mist particles that are within the  so-called "" empty space"". Now the movement off the Mist particles as I see it within my mental image is what energy is. And it is becoming incredibly hard for me too I would say write this down. Because when I come to this point my head starts to melt.

 I also would like to say that I couldn't in fact not write this down. So I used Google's speech texter  in order to help me write this. Because it is easier for me to explain it by words than it is for me to write it down. I say this because this might explain some of the misspellings I might have missed. And some of the confusing . And , Placements.

 So now I want to know. Is this very basic way of looking at things somehow correct. Or am I just completely lost. I really would like to know.

 Thank you in advance. Thank you for your help.",Physics,DoDHest,False,/r/Physics/comments/k7cta3/i_am_wondering_if_you_guys_could_help_me_with/

confuse about the paradox that quantum signal create,1607183213,"why must signal between two  entanglement particle is going back in time  , is it because the signal cross the speed of light or because the two particle are because the two particles might be  in difference  time frames . if it because of the signal cross the speed of light  isn't signal is not really  moves because it come trough only two points is not really cross big distance you cant check the location of this signal  in the middle for example let say single being send for point a to b if  it like radiation or particle that moving from point a to b then it moving through all space so you can say that the velocity of it is the distance divided by the time it took to signal to arrive ,but if signal going only from two points it like it cross the minimum distance and it velocity is still lower then light because it not cross big distance because distance is sum of the points you cross through . and the paradox create because the signal is being send from one time frame two another then if one clock ticking 3 times in one location  is ticking 4 times then you get that signal send to the past .but the signal that being send is not noticeable until you tell if particle been measured in the other location  ,which will be slower then light so there isn't any effect on the past , according to the no-communication theorem, so nothing can happens with information that haven't been send  . and for example let look at the properties of the location of the particle is not actually being change. because the all idea of quantum mechanics   is that it had a  chance to be there any way but just lower one according to his weave length so the past is not really change so no paradox",Physics,Traditional-Cat4797,False,/r/Physics/comments/k79ogu/confuse_about_the_paradox_that_quantum_signal/

How many parallel universes have ever existed?,1607109140,"Somehow the idea came into my head to calculate how many theoretical parallel universes could have existed during the entire lifetime of our universe. I decided that every possible state a parallel universe could be in would be created for every parallel universe every planck-time. To calculate the possible states of the universe I took the entire volume of the current observable universe and divided it by the volume of a hydrogen atom to get a result telling me in how many places an atom could exist at any one time. As to not overcomplicate things I assumed every atom have the volume of hydrogen. Seeing as there are 118 currently known elements on the periodic table (ignoring isotopes), any location in the universe could have any one of those elements or nothing giving each point 119 possible states. Scaled up to the entire universe, at any given time it is in one of 10\^(10\^107.9129536763352) possible states. I assumed that this would then also be how many possible parallel universes could exist at any one time. Every planck-time every parallel universe would generate every parallel universe possible. Scaling this up to the entire lifetime of the universe I got that 10\^(10\^(10\^46.03179540420047)) possible parallel universes have existed since the beginning of time. My original calculation to get this result is (119\^(((4×10\^80)/((240×3.14×4/3)/10\^12)\^3)\^(10\^44)))\^(4.3548594×10\^17). I calculated this all using wolfram alpha.

Is energy generation through the repulsion force of two magnets possible? (In the case of a shock dampener),1607092251,"(Reposted from MY OWN r/AskPhysics post)  I considered magnetic suspension, because inherently, a magnet is a progressive spring. The closer they are, the stronger the repulsion force. Then my dad pointed out, can we generate energy through said repulsion force? I imagine the lower (shaft/suspension arm mounted one) might get demagnetized... Not sure but it WILL be the one of the two vibrating more. Is the energy of that compression force enough to generate electricity? Is it negligible? I don't know how complex this is, but I'll be happy to move it to [r/physics](https://www.reddit.com/r/physics/) if it's too complex for this forum. (Welp, seems like that has come true.) 

I know, heat energy, law of conservation of energy, etc. means infinite energy is impossible... probably, without some revolutionary element, it's going to stay impossible. 

The suspension is a shock dampener... when the car rests on the shock, it compresses a spring... instead of (or at least in addition to) a spring, you use magnets, with n/s paired with the n/s (Causing repulsion) When the car goes up a steep hill, at speed, as it's accelerating (going up the curve) the suspension compresses due to Newton's First Law (Obj. in motion stays in motion unless acted upon by another force) The hill is this other, ""non-moving"" (relative) force, the suspension dampens the ""impact"" of going up that curve (acceleration), compressing the suspension. You reduce force by making the impact longer. That's what suspension does. I'm asking if there is a way to draw the compression force (kinetic)  or whatever energy those two magnets will generate, into electricity through the motion of the ""spring"" (the two magnets) Can that generate enough energy to power the lower Electromagnet (because i'm pretty sure a ""regular"" one will be demagnetized)? The upper one should be fine: it's not vibrating as much because it's attached to the car. Maybe the whole system won't be cost-effective, but there is one more benefit to that lower electromagnet.

&amp;#x200B;

Electromagnetic strength depends on the amount of current vs. quantity of metal (conductor, whatever), right? I know this is more like r/engineering or something, but it's also physics. We could have dynamic-stiffness suspension. Flat, level ground, with no acceleration (Any speed, as long as there's no acceleration), the car would have 50% power going to front+rear magnets. When accelerating, the rear suspension gets a higher percent of stiffness, and the front gets a lower percentage, keeping the wheels on the ground, more traction and therefore less gas to accelerate to the same speed in probably less time. Going uphill, this activates as well, increasing front wheel traction and giving more controllability. invert while going dowhill, and braking, it also keeps the body more level. There is the downside, however, that going downhill might reduce your visibility beyond acceptable levels (Which is at all, we have enough accidents, this is designed to make them less common, not more)  Going uphill will not be as big of an issue, you could still see what's right in front of you.

"I'm 16, and I just tried my first thought experiment. It's about the energy needed to heat the oceans by 1C°",1606941042,"!!! This has big numbers, and I can almost say with certainty that I calculated SOMETHING wrong, so please give me leeway if something doesn't seem right. If you spot an error, please tell me. A lot of the numbers I work from are also just estimates such as how much water there is, so I don't expect this to be nearly accurate, even if I did calculate properly. !!! 


&gt; How much water is in the oceans


There is a certain amount of water in the oceans. Estimates say that there are
""1 338 000 000"" cubic kilometers of water in the entire thing. 

If you convert it to cubic meters, then there are ""1 338 000 000 000 000 000"" cubic meters of water. There are 1000 liters of water in a cubic meter, so add 3 zeros and you have the liters of water in the ocean. 

That's 1.338 septillion liters. An -illion I've never heard of until I googled it for this. You could also say it's 1.338 billion trillion liters. In standard notation:
1.338 x 10²¹ L


&gt; Energy needed to heat the water 


It takes 3993 Joules in order to heat 1kg of salt water up by 1C°. It's also the energy needed to throw me (75kg) at 53 meters per second through the air. 

To simplify, we'll convert the Joules to Kilojoules to make the numbers smaller. 3993 Joules = 3.993kJ, and I'm gonna round up to 4kJ.

4kJ makes 1L of salt water hotter by 1C°


&gt; Calculating the heat


So to make the entire ocean heat up by 1C°, you need to multiply the number of liters in it by the heat capacity of 1L of saltwater.

That would work out to be be 5.352 x 10²¹ kJ. Written out in Kilojoules, it would be:

5 352 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 kJ 

And back in Joules:

5 352 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 J

&gt; Visualizing that number, and what it means

Let's turn that energy into Newtons. 1N (Newton) can move 1kg at 1m/s. The number of Joules stays the same when converted to N. 

Google says that Mount Everest is about 30 x 10¹⁴kg.

Written out:
3 000 000 000 000 000kg

It would take 30 x 10¹⁴ Newtons to accelerate Mount Everest by 1m/s.

That means that you could move Mount Everest 1 784 000 000m/s with the energy that it takes to heat up the ocean by 1C°

That's 1 784 000km/s. If the max speed of the universe was infinite, then that would be just under 6 times the speed of light.",Physics,Skunko,False,/r/Physics/comments/k5ho8z/im_16_and_i_just_tried_my_first_thought/

I presume that a cloud chamber that shows an electron that has just passed through a double slit/diffraction grating would reveal more information about that electron, such as the direction of its momentum at the point of detection, or is this already known from using a normal detector screen?

Thermocouple o’ questions,1606931959,"This may be a very silly problem with an easy answer but here-goes: I’m working on something somewhat unfamiliar to me and I’m using a thermocouple with the hot junction sealed onto a vessel that is to be heated up for the purposes of heating a catalyst inside the vessel for a reaction. The tricky part is that the two wires of the thermocouple are exposed for a fair bit of length after the hot junction before being braided/kept covered and separate until they are plugged in to the controller. This makes it difficult to keep the two wires separated for that exposed length, especially because I have to insulate and seal up the vessel that is being heated, so I imagine the wires will end up close/could touch midway between the junctions, which as I understand is a biiiig no-no.

My “thermocouple o’ questions” are:
1. Am I better off cutting some of the wire out and patching it back up for a shorter length

2. Is there a specific type of tape or something that I could quickly/easily wrap each wire in to keep them from making contact with one another that won’t disturb the effectiveness of the thermocouple?

To answer my own question I think the shorter length will still leave me with the same issue when it comes to wrapping everything up, so if there is a specific material/tape I can get to quickly wrap each wire in that would be preferable (ideally something that can withstand temperatures of around 450 degrees C).

Is it possible to generate a form of electromagnetic wave that would knock people out or cause temporary inability to perform (for humane purposes)?,1606884667,"I am asking this here because I was watching the movie ""American Sniper"" from 2014 yesterday with a friend, and in it I noticed that one of the major problems in the field is that when soldiers want to enter an area they have to either have a kind of overlook that would shoot down threats which is like gambling and is risky, or when they are under fire they just keep shooting at random places or at least towards where they think the fire must have come from.
This not only might cause civilians to be injured, it also causes a lot of ammunition to be wasted, and also a lot of bloodshed.
Now I was thinking what if in an unpopulated area (in a place where civilians are not present) that is filled with threats, like a suspected building, there was a form electromagnetic wave that is propagated and it would knock people out for a few minutes in a limited radius, and instead of shooting your way in, you can get in with ease, do your extraction, get your hostages, or maybe arrest the people that you seek, and no causalities, no body really dying from any side, no blood.
Is there a form of electromagnetic form that can knock people out without any health side effects, like they going crazy for ever or getting cancer and such?

Kepler’s conjecture that the planets known at the time are embedded in spheres connected by platonic solids. Although there’s obviously a lot wrong with this, and one could argue that Newtonian celestial mechanics are more elegant, I just think this idea sounds pretty cool.

Why don't WIFI signals interfere with each other wildly?,1606805175,"I recently read that some WIFI standards involve the sending of information through amplitude and phase modulation. Let's say you're in a location near a dozen WIFI routers. Each one is transmitting a bunch of radio waves at similar frequencies, with each going through an effectively unpredictable sequence of phase/amplitude values.

**How, when you connect to the WIFI at your location, can your receiver determine the precise value of the intended signal from a specific router, out of this unpredictable sum of phase angles and amplitudes from many different EM wavefronts passing through your location?**

This is a general question I have about EM wave interference, but I'm phrasing it with the case of WIFI because WIFI signals are variable even over short periods of time and because even in a small space, many WIFI signals of relatively similar strength are often present.

I was talking to a friend about this and he initially floated Fourier decomposition, but even if WIFI receivers were calculating that on the spot, which I'd doubt they are, the signals are of such an unpredictable nature that we figured it wouldn't be of any help. *I'm thinking that it might be possible to reconcile this if you look at each EM wave as a set of discrete items (like, photons) that only rarely interfere with each other, though I'm not sure if that explains it coherently, and I want to know if there is an explanation based just on classical electromagnetism*.",Physics,Revolutionary-Tea-73,False,/r/Physics/comments/k4fohh/why_dont_wifi_signals_interfere_with_each_other/

How does laser rangefinder work?,1606795068,"I hope someone much smarter than me could help.

How can laser rangefinders work in resolutions of something as tiny as mm? 

Principle of this is pretty easy and is only thing explained all over the web. Light travels from source, bounces from object and heads back. Only thing i need to measure is how much time it took and divide it by two.

The thing seems pretty simple, until you consider, that in one second, light travels freaking 300 000 000 metres.

I dont know about you, but I cannot count that fast.

And from what I know, neither can computers.

If i consider 1GHz processor, it ticks 1 billion times per second. If I understand that correctly, it can ""measure time"" only that fast, and only if a single tick is enough for that operation.

So, if my processor would tick every second and I pressed the button exactly on that tick, it could only measure distance in increments of 150000 km, because i wouldnt be sure what anything smaller than second was. And that is only if my processor would measure that second EXACTLY with no deviation.

By that logic if my processor ticks at 1GHz, it can measure 300 000 000 m /1 000 000 000 hz / 2 = 15 cm??

And that is considering each tick would be perfectly ""spaced"" and consistent. One tick would have to be the only thing it takes for the whole measurement operation.

Now... My logic must be flawed, because the laser rangefinders are more precise. They also have to use something much simpler and cheaper than such a fast processor... But how can you measure time in such a fast way? For something precise as 1mm, it would have to tick at 100Ghz...

Photon’s inertial frame of reference?,1606745853,"I have studied the special relativity, and one idea has bugged me. Since my major is not physics, my question may not be scientific. Please let me know if there is something wrong with my argument.

To the best of my knowledge, at the speed of light, time and distance become immeasurable due to the Lorentz transformation. Then, when we think about the inertial frame of reference of photon in vacuum, which is said to be traveling at speed of light, photon cannot have time and distance as dimensions in its frame. What photon observes should be traveling at speed of light according to the relativity, but in photon’s frame of reference, dimension of time and distance should not be distinguishable. Speed consists of two dimension, distance and time. How can it have speed when there is no concept of distance or time in its own frame?",Physics,reddit10233,False,/r/Physics/comments/k3wkg1/photons_inertial_frame_of_reference/

Calculating angular momentum,1606734050," I have disk (with radios r) rolling inside cylinder (with radios L) as shown in this [link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/UpzrI.png) and in this [link](https://d2vlcm61l7u1fs.cloudfront.net/media%2F927%2F927c152d-a0e1-4274-a37c-4a7e4b595b5a%2Fphp9kly5s.png).

The cylinder is stationary and the inner disk is rolling back and forth inside the cylinder with no slipping so the smaller disk is rotating around its center O' and around the outer cylinder center O. And I want to calculate the angular momentum about point O (Cylinder center).

From image in the link we can get:

phi\_dot = -(L - r)/r \* theta\_dot

* The negative sign is due to the different direction between theta and phi.

Then:

Ho = 0.5\*m\*r\^2\*phi\_dot + (0.5\*m\*r\^2 + m\*(L-r)\^2)\*theta\_dot = m \* (L\^2-2.5\*L+2\*r\^2) \* theta\_dot

Connection between LQG's Plank Star and recent advances in black hole information paradox?,1606679212,"A recent series of papers shedding some light on black hole information paradox has been widely publicized in mainstream media. Perhaps most notably in [this piece](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-black-hole-information-paradox-comes-to-an-end-20201029/) from Quanta Magazine.

The article describes in lay terms that the initial calculations based on AdS/CFT correspondence shows a weird space forming inside the black hole. The follow-up calculations based on Feynman's path integral applied to gravity showed that, eventually, the topology for the black hole's spacetime abruptly changes.

These descriptions bears striking resemblance to the concept of [Planck star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_star) as given by Wikipedia. In that theory, Heisenberg uncertainty principle applied to spacetime itself provides an outwards pressure preventing the formation of a singularity. That seems to be fundamentally the same concept that led to the topological change in black hole's spacetime in the recent calculations: the quantization of spacetime itself. Also, both results agrees that just below the event horizon there is a ""bubble"" of strange spacetime: the Plank star in LQG, and the region delimited by the extremal surface in the AdS/CFT calculation.

First year we had an awful second term with the SR lecturer unable to do her own problems and asking debated questions in a true or false fashion in the exam. That took my whole easter from other  courses I preferred. Second we had a guy who played with toys instead of teaching us Optics, a guy who I swear has early-onset-Alzheimer's not teaching us Solid State and someone whose EM course was ""read the textbook"". On top of it my grandfather died and my family forced me be coffin-bearer on the Monday when my exams were on Tuesday-Friday...  


Third year was nice. There were few problems with courses being run, tutelage etc. so I did well in the end (strange how that works).  


Now it's 4th year and I just wish I'd done a BSC and left last year. My courses were delayed by a month, but they were still running. So I was given access to 2/3 of my courses a whole month behind and have spent this term picking up the pieces for the January exams whilst my major project and research review (due Wednesday and worth a shit ton of my degree) has suffered tremendously.

I hate the mentality in this field of ""We dropped the ball?

Struggling to advance my problem solving skills.,1606554838,"Hello,

I posted this in r/PhysicsStudents about a week ago because I feel that it is a more appropriate place to post but literally received no comments or upvotes, not that upvotes matter though. 

This post is advice/motivation seeking. With all things considered that are happening in the world and my personal life right now, I am at a low point in motivation and would really just like to talk to some people about how they developed advanced problem solving skills and took their physics abilities to the next level. The obvious answer is to just do more studying and problems, I get that, and I am doing my best to do so, but doing it alone during the pandemic is harder than I thought it would be and I am not feeling good about it.

Background: I jumped into math/physics pretty late in my undergrad. I pulled some strings and took calc 1-4/vector, diff eq, and linear algebra before taking CM,QM,EM and thermo/stat mech. It was very difficult as I was playing catch up on the fundamentals while doing the junior/senior level courses. In the end I did well and graduated with my BS in physics. I am in a MS program now working towards becoming an optical engineer/scientist.

My program is going through Griffith's EM right now, which I used in undergrad as well. It's great review of material that is the foundation of optics and I do feel like I am slowly getting a little bit better at general problem solving, but I can't get rid of this sense that I just don't have what it takes to really take it to the next level that is required to do this type of work as a career. I am fully aware of the fact that I am quite depressed and have anxiety that is affecting how I perform, but that's a whole other situation to tackle on its own.

Even though my undergrad was very stressful and difficult I enjoyed the heck out of working with people and being part of a learning community. Now that I am doing my MS, which is online due to covid, I am really struggling to feel the same way doing everything solo.

I feel confident in my abilities to solve most of the problems in Griffith's EM that are spread throughout the chapter. I have recently been focusing on the difficult problems (marked by !) to try and advance my skills to the next level, which has been really hard and is making me feel worse. Every time I try one of these problems I spend a few hours trying different things and always end up over complicating things. Sometimes I'll sleep on it and come back to it the next day. Eventually I give up and look up the solution which is either simple and I just didn't see it, or subtle and idk how I would have come to the right realization. I want so badly to be able to solve these problems and know that I am progressing my skills but it just doesn't feel like I am really getting anywhere. Every time I look up a solution I get this feeling of utter defeat, pushing me further down the rabbit hole of self doubt.

I love physics and I really miss working with people but I feel that if I can't progress independently it's hopeless. Any and all advice/motivation is greatly appreciated.

If one frame is inertial for example they will describe the force as dP/dt (or ma if the mass is constant). But if the frame is not inertial they will describe that vector in a different way.

What generates lift on a wing?,1606529067,"Hello,

there is that bedtime story that says particles on top of a wing have a larger path to travel until reaching the trailing edge than on the bottom part of the wing, so in order to them to get at the same time at the trailing edge, ones must move faster. It turns out pressure is inversely proportional to velocity, according to Bernoulli's principle. And this creates the pressure differential. This is a basic explanation that suits very well, but it is wrong.   
As you can see by Holger Babinsky's videos, using a smoke technique, particles on top of the wing move faster and reaches the trailing edge first.

So, my question is, what generates the pressure differential? What generates lift?

I have a couple of questions regarding applying for PhD's. I'm a recent MSc Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics grad from the University of Manchester. I also did my undergraduate here, and a number of my coursemates who received top grades in their integrated master's courses continued on to start PhD's at top universities including Oxford.

1) My final undergraduate (BSc) grade was lower than I had hoped for due to personal issues, but I've turned it around completely in my MSc. I'm hopefully about to receive a top grade, and I have had a paper published as a first-author in a top journal based on my project. Of the coursemates that I mentioned who are at top universities, none had any published work prior to the beginning of their PhD. I'm currently sending off applications to start a PhD in astrophysics in the coming year, and I was wondering whether under such circumstances I would even have a chance with some of the top-level universities, or whether my undergraduate grade will remain a stain on my record.

2) My postgraduate work has revolved around SETI research, but I'm also very passionate about learning about cosmology and the early universe; I was wondering with my experience whether I would be considered for a PhD place in these disciplines.

Grade my ELI5 version of relativity. I have a thick skin.,1606495200,"Special relativity introduces the concept of spacetime. It’s easy to visualize 3-dimensional space and 1-dimensional time separately, but when combined into the concept of 4-dimensional spacetime it becomes much more difficult to understand. Spacetime is the structure, ether or fabric of the universe. 

Everything in the universe is moving through spacetime at the speed of light. The faster something is moving through space, the slower it moves through time. The sum of an object’s speed through space and its speed through time always equals the speed of light. When an object is at rest, not moving through space, it is moving through time at the speed of light. Likewise, a photon, which moves through space at the speed of light does not experience time at all.

One of the consequences of special relativity is time time dilation. If a spaceship is launched into space at a very high speed, to those of us on Earth, time on the spaceship would appear to have slowed down. To the people on the spaceship, time on Earth would appear to have sped up. When the spaceship returns to Earth the people on board will have traveled into the future.

Special relativity only works when objects are traveling at a constant speed and direction; it cannot handle objects which are accelerating. To account for accelerating objects in spacetime, we have to switch to general relativity. One of the most common examples of acceleration is gravity; falling objects accelerate toward the ground. General relativity, then, explains gravity.

General relativity explains how massive objects, like the Earth, distort spacetime. Matter distorts, or bends, spacetime but it distorts time much more than space. Time slows down for objects as they gets closer to a large mass. Clocks on the top floor of a tall building run faster than clocks on the ground floor. If relativistic time effects were not taken into account, the GPS in our cars would be off by almost 7 miles a day.

We experience the bending of time as gravity. Time at our heads is moving faster than time at our feet. As we saw in special relativity, moving faster through time means moving slower through space so our heads are moving through space slower than our feet. This is called a gradient and nature always tries to smooth out gradients. Wind is a gradient between high pressure and low pressure. A car engine extracts work from a gradient between temperatures. And gravity is nature trying to get your head moving at the same speed as your feet.

There are many other concepts that can be explained using relativity but they all require an understanding of spacetime.",Physics,mlavespere,False,/r/Physics/comments/k24ik0/grade_my_eli5_version_of_relativity_i_have_a/

Rotation of a beam due to a torque and Newton's 2nd Law,1606492596,"I'm struggling with the following concept.

If we have a uniform beam with a single pivot at its centre, and we apply two forces in opposite directions on opposite ends creating a couple moment, then Newton's 2nd Law states that (because the forces cancel out) there will not be any motion (or at least transnational motion?)

But, of course, there will be rotational motion, as there is a net moment on the beam. I am struggling to connect the idea of Newton's 2nd Law and the forces together with rotational motion, as my intuition keeps telling me that there should not be any motion whatsoever.

Does this have to do with the internal forces of the beam? Is it because, in the transnational case, we are analysing the beam as if it is a single particle, but in the rotational case, we are analysing it as if it is a ""line"" of multiple particles, and therefore (if we look at the particles on either end of the beam) the net force is in a direction so as to cause rotation? If this is the case, then what causes the force on the particles on either end that accelerates the particle ""inwards"" in the normal direction and causes the signature ""rotational"" motion instead of the particle just accelerating off into space?

Proof that Newton's 2nd Law can be analysed by breaking forces into components?,1606491616,"I've been doing a lot of ""deeper"" thinking about the sort of vector anaylsis that I've come across in my dynamics class.

I know that it makes intuitive sense, but I want to know if there is any sort of ""proof"" that we are ""allowed to"" analyse forces as vectors, which can ultimately be split up into various components, and therefore also analyse the acceleration of a particle into these components, or if this is simply one of those ""we've observed this as an accurate model for the real world and therefore take it to be true"" kind of moments in classical mechanics.

A simple use case of this is that of the angular motion of a person on a horizontal circular amusement park ride. If we have the component of the force on this person in the radial direction, and their mass, we can then calculate their acceleration in that radial direction. Similarly, we can calculate their acceleration in the transverse/angular direction. The magnitude of their overall acceleration can be calculated using pythag. But, ultimately, these two ""forces"" I've talked about above, are one force, caused by the seat of the swing pushing and pulling the person in a certain direction, which we've broken up.

#### ***[The earth machine](https://i.imgur.com/UsLmgre.jpg)***

The machine sends low energy photons down towards a solar panel through a gravitational field. Because of gravitational blueshift the photons decrease their wavelength and hence increase their energy. The light is then absorbed by the solar panel underneath, that converts the high energy photons to electricity that powers the light source all over again.

#### ***[The universe machine](https://i.imgur.com/p2HNMSt.jpg)***

This machine assumes a contracting universe. It is currently believed that the universe is expanding, and in that case it would unfortunately lead to the destruction of energy instead.

It works by sending out low energy photons from a light source, whose energy will increase as the universe contracts. The high energy photons are then absorbed by a solar panel placed far away, that powers a connected light source, that sends back new low energy photons, that are then absorbed by the original devices solar panel after being blueshifted. The whole time the photons recieved by the solar panels have more energy than the photons sent by the light source, leading to the system accumilating energy over time.

Intermediate axis theorem,1606344917,"So I am not sure if this belongs here but here is what I don't understand about the intermediate axis theorem:

Here we have an asymmetric [object that spins about the 2nd axis](https://thatsmaths.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/dzhanibekov-01.jpg). 

As you can see the from the graph, w1 and w3 increase exponentially but then at a certain point they decrease exponentially back to the original state and this repeats on forever.

When [these equations](https://hasanunlucom.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/screen-shot-2017-10-24-at-12-51-55-am.png) are solved for w1 and w3 we have that they are exponential functions (if I2 is the intermediate moment of inertia) and I undersrand the math behind that. (also w2 is constant so w2 dot = 0)

1. Why does w2 decrease rapidly and then after some time increase rapidly (see black line on graph)

I don't understand deep ocean water pressure (but I want to!),1606316941,"I recently re-watched the film The Abyss. For those who haven't seen it, it's meant to take place at the bottom of the ocean in an underwater oil drilling rig. The characters routinely go from oxygen environments to water and back again. 

I have always been told that the pressure at the bottom of the ocean is enough to crush things. So a few questions: 

1. If you had a habitat at a really deep depth, how could you make it so that there's a pool leading to the outside/ocean? Wouldn't the water just come flooding in? 
2. Let's say I have a pressurized room where there's a pool of water that leads to the outside. How would that water in the pool behave? If a drop an object into that water would it be crushed? If so why? If not, where would the crushing pressure kick in? 
3. In the film, there's a scene where they have a little two-man mini submarine. One actor opens a hatch set in the bottom of their vehicle and pushes out a remote controlled drone through it. If they were super deep (assuming the sub could take it) what would happen if you opened that hatch and stuck your arm in the water? Would your arm be crushed? 

Note that none of this is meant to be adversarial or to challenge facts. I'm not some deep water ""flat-earthist"".

Should I add a degree in physics?,1606248171,"Hello everyone.

Recently, my brother has been on a learning kick, specifically in the realm of physics. I went home this past weekend to see my parents and my brother before Thanksgiving, and while I was there I was helping explain to him some of the math behind physics. I ended up teaching myself some simple differential equations, and I learned how acceleration and velocity are related to displacement. This fact amazed me. I have always loved math but never had much experience in physics outside of a high school physics course. Because of how amazed I was, I ordered the Feynman lectures box set, The Theoretical Minimum by Leonard Susskind, Why does E=mc\^2 by Brian Cox and Jeff Forshaw, and Relativity by Einstein.

I am currently an undergraduate in my junior year studying computer science at Illinois State University. I am considering picking up a physics major. My brother says I should finish my degree and transfer somewhere else. I am seeking advice in this regard. Should I just add a physics degree to my current degree path? Or should I try applying to a better school? If I were to apply to another school, I was thinking of places like Oxford or Cambridge, however, I'm not sure if I'm even cut out for that.

I understand why it is zero at infinity and that we can not put two objects on the same place but we cant put any object at infinity either, there will always be gravitational force acting on it so that it will never be zero.

Making a water resistant time capsule,1606130007,"I am making a time capsule that will be buried in our school yard,  to be opened in 2030

So far the plan is for all the children in the classroom to write a short summary of this year (2020) on paper, find 1 magazine article and maybe put 1 small item of their choice (depends if there is room) 

The heart of the capsule will be a 10 Litre glass jar that has a rubber gasket and is air tight sealed. 

the jar will be placed in a big enough square wooden box which will be covered in cement,  then all the children will write their names before the cement sets. 

Now even that the jar is airtight and water sealed I believe condensation from the air which will be trapped inside when closed can still turn into water over the years.  From my knowledge concrete will still absorb some water from the soil and the temperature changes on the outside or the glass jar may turn the moisture inside the jar into water. 

This will over the years obviously destroy the contents. 

From my research so far I have these leads:

1.  Add moisture absorbing gel packets 
2. Fill the jar with a heavier then air gas which will force air out then quickly seal it
3. Leave a small candle burning and close the jar once all the oxygen is burnt off the candle will go out (not practical at all since room will be limited) 

What are some other ways I can make sure the contents will not be destroyed by condensation from the air inside the jar? 

I will do a few test runs with a much smaller jar and little bit of concrete to make sure it works out.",Physics,Brilliant_Tie_7425,False,/r/Physics/comments/jzfs2f/making_a_water_resistant_time_capsule/

Copenhagen vs Cognitive Dissonance,1606115425,"Copenhagen vs Cognitive Dissonance

Hey all, please explain to me like I’m 5 the current scientific agreement between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics contrasted with the following quotes:

The quantity of energy taken in or given out when electronic or other positions are shifted is always a “quantum” or some multiple thereof, but the vibratory or wavelike behavior of such units of energy is wholly determined by the dimensions of the material structures concerned.

The never-ending confusion attending the observation of the wave mechanics of quantum behavior is due to the superimposition of energy waves: Two crests can combine to make a double-height crest, while a crest and a trough may combine, thus producing mutual cancellation.

The so-called ether is merely a collective name to designate a group of force and energy activities occurring in space. Electrons and other mass aggregations of energy are uniform particles of matter, and in their transit through space they really proceed in direct lines. Light and all other forms of recognizable energy manifestations consist of a succession of definite energy particles which proceed in direct lines except as modified by gravity and other intervening forces. That these processions of energy particles appear as wave phenomena when subjected to certain observations is due to the resistance of the undifferentiated force blanket of all space, the hypothetical ether, and to the intergravity tension of the associated aggregations of matter. The spacing of the particle-intervals of matter, together with the initial velocity of the energy beams, establishes the undulatory appearance of many forms of energy-matter.

The excitation of the content of space produces a wavelike reaction to the passage of rapidly moving particles of matter, just as the passage of a ship through water initiates waves of varying amplitude and interval.",Physics,Aaronmichael88,False,/r/Physics/comments/jzczgy/copenhagen_vs_cognitive_dissonance/

MRI Surface Coils,1606093831,"I am an electrical engineering undergrad applying to biomedical PHD programs. This year(my senior year) I have been participating in an “internship” with a nearby medical center which focuses on MRI. For this internship we initially started by doing problems out of an MRI textbook and simulating them in MRI Lab which is a software in MATLAB. I expressed my desire to build something related to what we have been working on and my supervisor suggested building my own surface coils. He wants me to come up with a design I would like to build (I was thinking of a birdcage for mice) but the issue is that I have no clue how they work. I understand the principle since we have been going over similar systems but when I look over IEEE papers that discuss their design they model portions of the coil as inductors which are separated by capacitors. However, when viewing the document images the inductor portions just look like flat pieces of copper. Could anyone who has experience with surface coils explain what these sections are? Are the coils taped over with metallic tape or are they actually just solid sheets? I was expecting them to look like gradient or RF coils. If they are a solid sheet how  are they able to be modeled as inductors?

"Studying physics without the pure math; is it possible? Or can you ""physicify"" the pure math?",1606082940,"Hello r/Physics,

a little bit about myself: I live in the Netherlands and I'm currently in my first year of the Applied Physics bachelor. I have ADD and for me this means I'm an intrest based learner. I can learn everything as long as I'm intrested in it.

I absolutly love physics and I have managed to get some pretty good grades. However math is another story. It takes a lot of energy to learn math on its own. And on the exams, my knowledge of math just vanishes.... I was 0.3 points short to pass the first math class and I'm falling behind on the next one...

I really really want to keep studying this high level of physics, because it brings me joy. I love the challenge and the concepts.

So that's why I wanna ask two questions:
1. Is there a study which only gives math through physics? Where you learn math by applying it to less abstract problems

2. Can you make math less abstract? The numbers in math don't have a meaning to me like those in physics. Is there a way to give them this sense of meaning?

Question re. basic thermal physics,1606080007,"My understanding is that one of the reasons water has such a higher specific heat capacity is due to the many possible motions it can undergo (ie. translational, which contributes to heat, but also rotational and hydrogens moving with respect to each other etc.). However, why is it that when salt (or any solvent) is added, the specific heat capacity decreases? This may be stupid, but this seems to not make sense, as they can no longer perform translational motion given they're in cage formations, but can't they still perform other motion? I assume that for the SHC to decrease it would have to go the other way (they can only move translationally).

On a new centralized research platform,1605976905,"Hey fellows!

What's up? 👋🏽👋🏽

I am Alain, PhD student in Mathematical Modelling for physical systems at the University of Oxford.

Together with friends, we've been building a centralized platform built for researchers to advertise their research in a **more** **effective and time-saving way**.  We believe that the way academicians are sharing their results is still very archaic and can really benefit from modern technologies, so we built a place where you can advertise your online seminars and easily  browse through other communities' seminars as well.

You might think that this is a temporary solution due to COVID-19, but our vision goes much further than that. Being in world-class institutions, we realize how lucky we are to have access to talks by leading researchers, so we want to share them as broadly as we can. Also, traditional seminars use a lot of resources to invite a speaker on-site to give a short talk. In the era of climate change, we must take responsibility and only travel when is required.

We thus believe that a hybrid approach of in-person and online audience  will be the future of seminars, and we are building our platform around this vision.

I invite you to have a look at the website [https://agora.stream](https://agora.stream/)! We released the platform very recently and already have more than 50 leading research groups from Oxford, Imperial College, MIT and all over the world publishing content on a regular basis.

If our vision resonates with you or if you know anybody this might be useful to, please do spread the word! :)

Feel free reach out to me if you have any question / feedback or would like to meet for a chat! [https://calendly.com/remy-mess/e-coffee](https://calendly.com/remy-mess/e-coffee)

See you very soon! 💪🏽

It’s a Paradoxon because something enters the 3D which originate isn’t the 3D. The ufo itself becomes a Paradoxon and huge forces force the craft to become the one thing or the other thing.

a Richard Feynman history,1605913747," 

Our physics club has an event called Science Cafe, in which a guest speaker (usually a physics professor) would come eat at a restaurant with us and talk about their life, career, and advice. In the mid-80s, a student convinced Richard Feynman to be the guest speaker and he actually came on the condition that it would not be advertised (only physics majors as he didn’t want too many people due to his fame) and physics faculty can come, but may not ask questions (it was meant for the students). 

He also agreed to host a seminar on particles at our school, under the condition that his name would not be given when advertising the seminar (this way, only the people who would actually show up would be people with genuine interest to here about the topic).

The club advisor at the time can be seen giving Feynman “bunny ears!” Earlier, Feynman stated that he was annoyed and tired of all the formality he had been through getting awards, and he once gave a chemist bunny ears at a Nobel Prize photo shoot! This story has not been told, as far as I know, in any of the books he has written. I can’t find the photo of Feynman doing that, and it may be possible that they redid the photo shoot or edited it out.

How does the sub-field of my MSc project affect my PhD applications?,1605869964,"I'm a physics master's student and I will complete my degree by the summer of '22. I'm broadly interested in high energy and condensed matter. One of the profs in my department is offering a project (for the MSc) in high energy that I'm very interested in. He added that he's looking to publish a paper at the end of this project so I will need to commit to doing this throughout the MSc. I've also taken one of his classes so I have some familiarity with him. The project is theoretical and he said it won't involve any kind of computation/data science component. The project is about gravity and information around black hole event horizons.

My question is the following: Suppose I wanted to switch to condensed matter after my masters, would I be at a disadvantage because my MSc project was not in condensed matter? I understand that while applying to grad school in the US, you don't apply to a single prof or a research group, but in Europe you do (?). I'm mainly looking at graduate programs in Europe so that is why I am having trouble with this decision.

Would it help if I have a publication but it is not in condensed matter, as opposed to having done a project in high energy (while applying to condensed matter profs/groups)?

* At high enough energies, the Higgs field ""[cannot] grant mass""
* For particles which retain their mass regardless of Higgs breakdown, their kinetic energies were so high that their rest mass energies were ""effectively"" zero in relative terms

Two questions:

* Why can't the Higgs field grant mass at high energies?
* In order for CCC to be true, wouldn't rest masses have to be *truly* zero, not just *very close* to zero?",Physics,beforevirtue,False,/r/Physics/comments/jxm81s/why_were_particles_effectively_massless_at_the/

Is Buoyancy Just a Result of Gravity?,1605845757,"Hey this thought came to me while I was learning in physical science class and I was wondering if is true and already confirmed, or completely wrong.

I feel like buoyancy is like centrifugal force, that it is in reality the result of other forces at play. In Newton’s Law of Gravitation, it states that the more massive and closer two objects are, the more attractive force there is between them. 

If you were to look at objects as people in relationships, then massive amounts of a liquid and very massive objects don’t like having hot air up in their relationship because the gravitation between them is stronger than the gravitation between the massive object and the thing that is coming between them, so the liquid’s downward force is stronger and overtakes the less dense, less massive thing until it is in a sufficient position where its downward force exceeds the downward forces above it.

A HOLE THROUGH THE EARTH (help),1605829948,"Hello great people!

Me and a friend of mine recently got into quite a heated debate. Neither of us are educated enough to come to a proper conclusion for our debate, which is why I turn to you guys and hopefully someone who would have the knowledge to give me an educated answer to this. Not necessarily with the formulas or calculations, but the shortest and simplest easy to understand answer possible since I'm sure there are a ton of factors that we didn't take into consideration.

So here's the deal.

The Earth's diameter is 12, 742km. Lets imagine that we could drill a perfect hole from the north pole to the south pole that was 10km in diameter. Now lets also imagine we had a perfect sphere made out of steel with a diameter of 1km. 

Here is where our debate comes in. If the sphere was dropped dead center in the 10km hole going through the earth, would the insane velocity of the giant sphere because of it's incredible weight be enough, to pass through the middle of the earth and keep going towards the other side of the whole and then into outer space OR would the gravity working in the opposite direction after passing through the middle be enough to pull it back down towards the middle and then eventually come to a stop.

I am not sure that this is the best place to ask this question, but I am sure someone here will know. It it just out of my own curiosity. I tried googling an answer but wasn't sure how to phrase the question and didnt get any good results.

In my mind, you are always orbiting around something, right? If escape Earth's SOI, I am now orbiting the Sun. If I escape the Sun's SOI, I am now orbiting something else, right?

New Physics Simulations for ~ High School Classrooms.,1605459063,"Hey /r/physics

It's been a while since I did a big update. There are few new simulations but *a lot* of new versions. I always have believed that students should have the simulation show exactly what they need; these versions help teachers create that.

But after talking up the new versions of old apps, I'd still like to start with the new stuff:
## New Versions of the Collision Simulation - Now with data and springs ##

The [old collisions app](https://whscience.org/collisions/) still stands but there are several new versions:

[Collisions Springs](https://whscience.org/collisions/springs/) - **Physics** - Carts with variable mass and velocity now have variable stiffness springs. The app records, velocity/acceleration/force vs time data and displays on graphs. Students can download the data as csv. Great for showing Newton's 3rd Law.

[Collision Wall](https://whscience.org/collisions/wall/) - **Physics** - One cart collides with an immovable wall. Just like the two carts version, this one shows velocity/acceleration/force vs time data that is downloadable.

[Collision Carts](https://whscience.org/collisions/carts/) - **Physics** - Just shows final velocities. Mostly the same as the original collisions app but updated to match the carts asthetic and range of values as the others. Useful point to start if you plan on using the spring or wall version. 

## New Versions With Statistical Noise for Linear Regression ##

This year I started by talking about slope as Δy/Δx and got students comfortable with measuring quantities like acceleration from a graph using that. I am now starting to have them use excel/sheets and use linear regression instead to find slope when there is statistical noise. These apps allow them to do that and practice their high school level analyzing and interpreting data practice.

[Gravity Data](https://whscience.org/gravitydata/) - **Physics** -  The app records position/velocity vs time data with some noise. Students can download the data and use linear regression to find the acceleration. They can run the simulation more times to gather more data and see their slope stabilize around a more accurate value.

[Pull Cart Find Mass](https://whscience.org/pullcart/findmass/) - **Physics** - Similar to the [original pull cart simulation](https://whscience.org/pullcart/) which also has noise, students drag three different colored carts around to generate force and acceleration data and then download as a CSV. Their goal is to find the unknown mass of each cart. There is also a version of the pull cart sim with [no noise](https://whscience.org/pullcart/nr/) to have students use slope first. 

Since I am only recently incorporating this skill, expect more apps with a clean data and noisy data version coming this year.

## Other New Versions ##

[Space Ship with Measuring Tools](https://whscience.org/spaceship/mt/) - **Physics** There is a new mission in the space ship app. Also, I added a version that has a tool to measure distance between two points. The points are draggable.

[Air Pressure Paper N](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/N) - **Phys/Chem** - The same as the [old air pressure paper app](https://whscience.org/airpressurepaper/) but students can control the number of particles so that they can find a relationship between pressure and N as well as pressure and area.

[Ants V](https://whscience.org/ants/v) - **Physics** - Another version of the beloved [ants app](https://whscience.org/ants/). This time a single ant walking across the screen. Students find its speed then use it to measure distance. See also [ants II](https://whscience.org/ants/ii), [ants II](https://whscience.org/ants/iii), and [ants II](https://whscience.org/ants/iv)

[Heat Capacity](https://whscience.org/heatcapacity) - **Chemistry** - Not so much a new version as a major bug fix. It was using the wrong units for the metal ball specific heats but now is fixed. 

[Block Ramp Graph](https://whscience.org/blockramp/graph/) - **Physics** - Similar to the original [block ramp app](https://whscience.org/blockramp/), this version shows a velocity vs. time graph so students can use slope to find acceleration. The amount of friction is random each time you open the app. 

[Water Temperature](/watertemperature/) - **Chemistry** - Updated to the beaker and dish can have equal volumes. Place a small beaker of water into a larger dish of water. Can control the initial temperatures and volumes. Shows the temperature over time. Can export data as csv.

Statics: Finding the Force (Also negative degrees?),1605422487,"I finished doing a statics problem and I realized I didn't do the counterclockwise or clockwise thing, is it going counterclockwise positive? I think it is but not exactly how to tell clearly by looking at the 410N and maybe force P? Would the first picture (the one before the given long problem that isn't what I wrote, the y and x-axis thing with the arrow going counter clockwise) be the right one: counterclockwise positive?

I'm really confused. at the -88.98 degrees part.

Also got a negative degree which is -88.98 for the direction of the force acting at point C \[angle for part b\] but not sure how to write it with the right angle notation (i wrote a few on the bottom right that I saw before for other problems I saw for the angle symbol thing).

Questions about electromagnetic radiation,1605381738,"Good day physicists of reddit! 

My name is Rik. I'm 17 years old. I'm from the netherlands and am in the last grade of middle school. To graduate this year we have to perform some sort of research and write a paper about it. Me and my friend are researching the effects of electromagnetic radiation and 5G. We have a few questions that we'd like to get an answer to, but the professors we sent e-mails to haven't responded. Thus we're asking you. If you are one to answer our questions we would really appreciate it if you'd tell us your last name and profession too for refference. (either as a direct message, or just in the comments) It shall only be used in the paper. Now onto the questions: 

1. How does electromagnetic radiation work and how can we visualise this? 

2. How does transmitting information with electromagnetic radiation work? (Think of transmitting data with wifi) 

3. What influences the effectivity of electromagentic rafiation? 

4. What would you use to stop electromagnetic radiation? (Walls, certain materials, etc.) 

5. From a physics standpoint, what could be improved for electromagnetic radiation/5G? (Think of things like how far it reaches, or how strong the signal is) 

We hope to get some answers on these questions so we can write a complete and informative paper.

How is my answer to this question incorrect? (Magnetic field on a wire due to other wires),1605377624,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p9ir6b57x8z51.png?width=900&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c66ac5da84c6aaef79a7130b1c1f5a5201f092bc

So using the right hand rule, the magnetic field of the wire below A goes to the right. Due to the distance between this wire and the other wire and A being smaller, the force of this wire's magnetic field will be greatest. So if I were to draw the force of the bottom wire on A, I'd have a long component pointed to the right.

For the wire to the right, using the right hand rule, the magnetic field will be pointed vertically.

Since we established this force will be smaller than that of the first wire, we now have two force components on A that look like so,

\^

\-----------------------------------   &gt;|

(not to scale). So the angle between A and the resulting net force vector will be less than 45 (since the ""x"" component is larger than the ""y"" component).

because this angle is less than 45, the remaining angle between A and the vertical line has to be greater than 45 degrees.

Where in this did I go wrong?

Infinite and the scope of the multiverse,1605332348,"This is an idea i've had in my head since I was a kid, and im sure it wont be considered credible by anyone who understands physics, but id like to understand why im wrong.

Obviously there are larger and smaller infinites, so I have no idea what kind of scope the multiverse is talking about--- assuming the infinite multiverse is large enough, I thought as a kid, isnt it possible that essentially every variation of reality does exist?

I.e in our universe the big bang theory is a sitcom running twelve seasons, but given the sheer size of the multiverse, we could also say the sitcom is real-- in another universe.

Explanation of the Interference Patterns of Light by the Particle Model ( Part 1 ),1605296779,"# Introduction

Thomas Young, speaking on 24 November 1803, to the Royal Society of London, began his now-classic description of the historic experiment:

&gt;*The experiments I am about to relate ... may be repeated with great ease, whenever the sun shines, and without any other apparatus than is at hand to every one.*

Young describes an experiment where he placed a card about 0.85 millimeter thick into a light beam from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of color in the shadow .

After this experiment, which had great repercussions in the scientific world, Newton's century-old view that light is a particle, expressed in the book Opticks, was brought up for discussion. And so, perhaps the most important discussion of physics, ""Is light a wave or a particle?"" discussion has begun.

After the double slit experiment, the idea that light consists of waves was confirmed; But, The question ""What is the wave?"" was not answered.

Physics theories of the late 19th century assumed that surface water waves must have a medium in order to move, which is water. Likewise, sound waves needed air to propagate. Therefore, light had to need a medium, ""ether"", to transmit its wave motions. Since light can travel through a vacuum, it was assumed that even vacuum must be filled with ether.

Two physicists named Albert Abraham Michelson and Edward W. Morley prepared an experiment in 1881 to prove the ether experimentally.

The main idea of the experiment was this; The Earth rotates around the Sun at about 30 km / s, and according to the stationary aether hypotheses, the Earth and the aether are in relative motion, indicating that the ""ether wind"" must exist. Therefore, if a beam of light is sent against the ether wind, the light should slow down (c-v), but if it is sent in the other direction, the light should accelerate (c + v). In other words, the doppler effect had to be observed.

If a light source is moving away from an observer, a redshift occurs; blue shift occurs if the source moves towards the observer. This applies to all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the doppler effect.

However, ether is not required to observe the Doppler effect. If we assume that there is no ether and that light propagates in space and use Galilean Space-Time transformations, we do the same calculations again and we come to the conclusion that there must be a phase shift due to the delay. In other words, the Michelson-Morley experiment does not prove neither the existence nor the absence of ether.

With or without ether, according to the experimental result, in all cases there should have been a phase shift due to the doppler effect. But the expected phase shift never happened. This was the main thing that surprised scientists. After this experiment, the physics understanding of ""absolute time and variable speed of light"" was switched to ""absolute speed of light and relative time"". In fact, scientists have tried to explain why the expected doppler effect did not happen by the understanding of ""absolute speed of light and relative time"".

Everyone was so sure that the bright and dark fringes on the interferometer were caused by interference in light waves, that no one had thought that it could be anything but interference. Perhaps the Michelson-Morley experiment was actually proving that the bright and dark fringes were not caused by interference.

Let's take the subject from a different perspective and examine how the seeing phenomenon occurs biologically; In our eye, the retinal molecules (11-cis-retinal) in Rod and Cone cells absorb the photon with the appropriate energy and flatten into the all-trans-retinal configuration.

In Experiments, we learned that when an atom or molecule absorbs a photon, its electrons can move to higher-energy orbitals, and the atom or molecule makes a transition to a higher-energy state. In retinal, absorption of a photon promotes a **π** electron to a higher-energy orbital (a **π**\-**π**\* excitation). This excitation ""breaks"" the **π** component of the double bond, thus allowing free rotation about the bond between carbon atom 11 and carbon atom 12 (see Figure 1.0). Thus, when 11-cis-retinal absorbs a photon in the visible range of the spectrum, free rotation about the bond between carbon atom 11 and carbon atom 12 can occur and the all-trans-retinal can form.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.0 - Absorption of a photon in the visible range, 11-cis-retinal can isomerize to all-trans-retinal. ](https://preview.redd.it/id8cbx5n82z51.jpg?width=300&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0a73cb79640a7364df2d4021c8bf837ad3229c55)

If the bright and dark fringes in the double slit experiment were caused by interference, we would not be able to see these fringes. Because, in our eyes, the mechanism that enables light to transform into electro-chemical signals was not designed to convert these waves into signals. The system is based on absorbing the photon and raising the **π** electron to a higher energy orbit. In other words, the seeing mechanism is not designed to convert waves that emanate from a single source and propagate like water waves into signals.

In order for us to see the bright and dark fringes, photons in the light region must be reflected on the screen and absorbed by retinal molecules in our eyes.

# Interference and Diffraction

Two centuries after Thomas Young, with the development of technology, an experimental system that sends photons to the screen one by one was developed and the Young experiment was repeated. Surprisingly, in the double slit experiment, the same interference patterns occurred when individual photons were sent to the slits (see Figure 1.1).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.1 ](https://preview.redd.it/wmdm0v9r82z51.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfabb0660b0934e67b9f4de492c6dbbbcd3f92c6)

As shown in Figure 1.1, a photon leaves a trace at only one point on the screen. But as time passes, the traces left by tens of thousands of photons on the screen create interference patterns.

In 1989, the company hitachi sent electrons to the slits one by one in an interference experiment, and again, bright and dark fringes appeared, as in Young's experiment. At different times, these experiments were also tested with neutrons, atoms, and even molecules, and bright-dark interference patterns occured each time.

The explanation that while passing through slits, particles produce copies of themselves and interfere with them is against the conservation of energy, which is the 1st law of Thermodynamics. No photon, electron, atom or molecule can create its own copy from nothing. This explanation is against thermodynamics.

Since bright-dark fringes occur when we send the particles to the slits one by one, this must be due to something else, not interference. To find the answer to this question, we will take a look at the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

With the experiment carried out by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach in 1922, we have gained more information about the magnetic moments of electrons. The Stern–Gerlach experiment involves sending a beam of silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field and observing their deflection. I will talk about a very interesting analogy between the Young and Stern-Gerlach experiments.

I will develop a new experimental system based on the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Front and side view of the Stern-Gerlach Experiment System can be seen in Figure 1.2. In the experimental system I will create, I will use its side view. For the sake of simplicity, I will call it the ""*SG experiment setup*"" instead of the Stern-Gerlach.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.2 - Front \(a\) and side \(b\) views of the \\""Stern-Gerlach experiment setup\\"" ](https://preview.redd.it/sjgsflzx82z51.jpg?width=400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e384f7bc1f8c3ebf947921fcf1a5b17189260e9)

Also, I will name the deflection angles of the particles as + α and -α in the SG experiment.

Suppose we put two SG experimental setups side by side (see Figure 1.3). Particles deviating from the 1st SG experimental setup with an angle of ± α will have a deflection angle of ± 2α after leaving the 2nd SG experimental setup. For each SG experimental setup added, an α angle is added.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.3 - Two SG experiment setups ](https://preview.redd.it/e3t7fiv392z51.jpg?width=476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b3cea898109be0657872d2a7286353d9e3513307)

If we reverse the 2nd SG experimental setup (see Figure 1.4); In the 1st SG experimental setup, the particle deflecting upward with an angle of + α deviates downward with an angle -α after the 2nd SG experimental setup, and hence + α and -α cancel each other out. In other words, when the particle leaves the SG experimental system , it continues to move in a direction parallel to the x axis. Likewise, in the 1st SG experimental setup, the particle deflecting downward by -α angle deviates upward with the angle + α in the 2nd SG experimental setup, and therefore + α and -α cancel each other out.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.4 - Opposite SG setups ](https://preview.redd.it/t6bk4ox892z51.jpg?width=422&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=96f75902419b9856f2421099c0689726d71fca19)

In other words, the particle continues to move in a direction parallel to the x axis at an angle of 0 degrees. Since the 1st and 2nd SG experimental setups are opposite to each other, there is no deviation when the particles exit the system.

If we do not know the magnetic field direction in SG experimental setups, we calculate all the possibilities in both setups. As a result, 3 paths occur; + 2α, 0, and -2α. (see Figure 1.5)

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.5 - All the ways the particle can go ](https://preview.redd.it/lnygpibc92z51.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e0fd0d403617c1d54e467f6c782636eb7055e8e6)

Note: The system consisting of more than one ""SG experiment setup"" is called ""SG experiment system"" in the rest of the article.

Let's add a 3rd SG experimental setup to the SG experimental system (see Figure 1.6) and calculate the paths the particles can follow. When all are in the same direction, the Particles deflect up by an angle of + 3α or down by an angle of -3α. They deviate by an alpha angle in each SG experimental setup they pass. If one or both of the SG experimental setups are in opposite directions, the particles deflect up or down by an angle ± α.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.6 - Triple SG experiment system ](https://preview.redd.it/2b2xcnvf92z51.jpg?width=619&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2a0f93d4961814a800eb21f0b96c700c7f39fde)

When we calculate all the probabilities, 4 separate paths emerge. ± 3α and ± α.

Based on all this information, let's develop a larger experiment consisting of N sets of SG experiment setups (see Figure 1.7). The number of paths that particles are likely to follow through this system will be equal to N + 1. Deviation angles continue as 0, ± α, ± 2α, ± 3α… ± Nα.

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.7 - N pieces of SG experiment setup ](https://preview.redd.it/43b1vgli92z51.jpg?width=987&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b56988603ff6043e85c0e0679abeb745e30576f0)

**Which path and how often do particles pass?** In order to make calculations, I simulated the SG experiment system in computer environment and experimented with 1 million particles. Different SG experiment system was created for each particle and random N (N &lt;= 50) SG experimental setups were created in each experimental system.

For example, 47 SG experimental setups for the 1st particle were placed side by side and the magnetic field direction of each SG setup was randomly generated up or down. For the 2nd particle, 36 SG experimental setups were placed side by side and again the magnetic field direction of each SG setup was randomly generated up or down. This process was repeated 1 million times. A graph like in Figure 1.8 appeared.

[ Figure 1.8 - Density Distribution of particles ](https://preview.redd.it/1htjr59n92z51.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4b3357e6716ad39a28d3b33dd7f792696953a9cf)

As can be seen in Figure 1.8, the density distribution of the paths followed by the particles in the simulation of the SG experiment system is similar to the density distribution of the paths followed by photons in Young's experiment (see Figure 1.9).

&amp;#x200B;

[ Figure 1.9 ](https://preview.redd.it/7p68a69q92z51.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d24b8b28c9147c42fd1b328aa975c7195cdd0797)

Figure 1.9 shows N SG experimental setups, the paths of the particles passing through this system and the density distribution of the particles passing through these paths.

In the double slit experiment, the effect of the slits on light is neglected and only the properties of the light is taken into account. But when we examine the surface of the slit that appears neutral, we see opposing electric and magnetic fields that differ in atomic size.

In imaging techniques such as AFM (Atomic Force Microscpe), STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope), MFM (Magnetic Force Microscope), these atomic-sized electrostatic and magnetostatic forces on the surface are used. These imaging techniques have shown us that when we consider surfaces on a micro scale, we cannot think of them as one-piece neutral as in classical physics.

Since all electrostatic and magnetostatic forces on the surface act simultaneously on macro objects, the resultant of the total forces becomes 0 and the macro objects pass through the slits without being affected.

But only one of these forces acts on nanoparticles at a particular time and location. Not all of them act at the same time.

For example, when an electron travels close to the surface, it is affected by either positive charges or only negative charges on the surface at a certain location. Thus, the electrostatic force either moves the electron away from the surface or brings it closer to the surface. As the electron moves across the surface, the direction of the electrostatic force constantly changes. As in the SG experimental system above, the forces acting along the path change direction. These forces act on the particle randomly and in succession along the path, and deviations occur in the path of the particle according to a certain order. The cumulative sum of these paths, on the other hand, causes the particles to concentrate in certain areas, resulting in bright-dark patterns.

A situation similar to the SG experiment system above occurs between the slit surfaces and the photons. Each photon passes through a path close to the surface and is under the influence of different electrostatic and magnetostatic forces. Either both or only one of these forces act on the photons, causing the paths of the photons to change.

CMV: Common answers to the Twin Paradox are incorrect.,1605281691,"The classic twin paradox: one twin stays on Earth and the other twin travels to some distant star and back at a significant fraction of c, and ages slower due to relativistic time dilation. However, from the inertial frame of reference of the travelling twin, he could be stationary, and the one on Earth could be moving away from him (along with the Earth and the background stars). So from his perspective, that twin should have aged slower. So, which one ages slower?

&amp;nbsp;

Some answers I've seen online say that the acceleration of the travelling twin is what makes this problem asymmetric. When he accelerates to turn around, he is briefly in a non-inertial frame of reference. However, I have trouble accepting this answer because it implies that there is such a phenomena as *absolute acceleration*.

&amp;nbsp;

I've come to this belief after watching this series of videos by the YouTube channel Dialect. You really only have to watch the last video to get the crux of their argument, but I will also explain my interpretation:

1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRuVGOm7560

2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGoAZKyI6ZY

3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0OI1IFLXGk&amp;

&amp;nbsp;

My interpretation of their argument is that because acceleration is relative, i.e. *absolute acceleration* does not exist, and the forces required for acceleration are impossible to objectively measure, there is no way to tell which twin will experience time dilation relative to the other.

&amp;nbsp;

I think the biggest objection to this argument is that acceleration is impossible to objectively measure. But let me explain. Sure, an accelerometer would measure that the twin is accelerating in his rocket, but given the frame of reference of the rocket, there is no way to know whether a force is acting on the rocket, or a force is acting on the accelerometer as well as the other twin. Any accelerometer works because part of it is in a different frame of reference e.g. a mass on a spring swings back in an accelerating rocket because it is momentarily stationary with the external frame of reference. If the mass on the spring were also being accelerated by the same forcefield, there would be no way to tell if the rocket were accelerating.

&amp;nbsp;

To push this point further, if the twin were a single particle being accelerated by an electric field, he would be unable to tell if he were truly accelerating or his twin was. If acceleration is relative, then it seems to me there is no way to tell which twin would age slower than the other. Yet one of them does. So in a purely relativistic framework, what determines which twin experiences time dilation?

[meta] On the lack of research articles on this subreddit,1605260239,"Recently, [there was a discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/jst4lq/meta_is_there_a_physics_subreddit_thats_strictly/) about having a subreddit strictly for academic journal articles. Such a subreddit was even founded during the discussion.

Some users, such as /u/kzhou7 and /u/sigmoid10 , pointed out that such content doesn't really survive on this subreddit, because few people here have enough expertise to be able to read research papers in any given field. On the other hand, popular articles which are written about recent research tend to be extremely light on details, to the point where some of the posts on the sub are more or less a lengthy string of buzzwords. It's not the first time we've had this discussion on this sub. If we want more good content on research articles, we need a strategy.

One way that I can think of is articles in Reviews of Modern Physics. They are written in such a way that even if you're not an expert in, say, climate science, you can still go read their recent article on progress in climate science as long as you have a good general university-level physics education. Not only are they usually possible to read by a person who is not an expert in that particular field, but Rev. Mod. Phys is also highly reputable and often has articles from the very best experts of their field.

Now, since reading Rev.Mod.Phys doesn't necessarily require deep expertise, a person who has a degree in physics could read it and write a popular summary that still goes in to enough details to explain the fundamentals of the field. Perhaps doing so would generate fruitful discussion between enthusiasts and experts. It seems to me that the subreddit doesn't shy away from all technicalities and math, since my own post a few days ago, which did include basic linear algebra, calculus and programming, seemed fairly popular: thus one could summarize in a way that includes details without going in to the most difficult technicalities, at least for some fields.

So, does anyone have any other ideas for bringing more research in to the subreddit? Do you think what I outlined here is still too casual? Also would like to hear from people who are not necessarily physics experts but are undergraduates or otherwise read some of the semi-technical material in this sub -- does this sort of thing seem interesting to you?

I'm willing to take a stab at this sort of effort myself, but only if there's some sort of discussion of the idea first.

Objective Collapse Theories,1605244033," 

Story: Facing the decision to decide where the Heisenberg cut is and to resolve the unnatural process of having two kinds of evolution, that is to have the deterministic unitary evolution of wavefunction via the Schrödinger equation vs the sudden, irreversible collapse of wavefunction, these people try to modify quantum or to say that gravity comes in so as to introduce an objective manner to collapse the wavefunction and the Heisenberg cut can be calculated from each theory to be tested. GRW theory modified the Schrödinger equation to be non linear so that each individual wavefunction has a small chance of spontaneously collapsing, but when added to become a complex system, it becomes almost certain to collapse within a short time.

Penrose’s version uses gravity. That is the quantum uncertainty of a massive object would make its position uncertain, correspondingly the warping of spacetime by the massive object is different, thus gravity doesn’t tolerate quantum weirdness at larger scale and collapses the wavefunction.

Properties analysis.

This kind of objective collapse avoids having to rely on consciousness, and observers, so no observer role in it. Since there’s collapse and a clear Heisenberg cut to separate the small quantum realm and the big classical realm, there’s naturally no universal wavefunction. Insisting on collapse of wavefunction, it regards wavefunction as real, and therefore cannot be a local theory, all these three properties it shares with consciousness causes collapse.

The other four properties of no determinism, yes to unique history (only one world), no hidden variable and no counterfactual definiteness follows from Copenhagen’s interpretation as well.

So the classical score for this one is three out of nine. The same score as consciousness causes collapse.

Experiments explanation

Double-slit with electron.

Electrons hitting any measuring device, be it screen or the photons which are trying to determine which slit it goes through collapses due to entanglement with large collection of quantum objects.

Stern Gerlach.

The measuring device of the magnets consists of large amounts of atoms and electrons which according to GRW would almost immediately spontaneously collapse and as the whole thing is entangled, it brings the collapse along to the whole measurement apparatus and then to the silver atoms crossing into it too.

Bell’s test

Collapse happens as per usual, similar to the cases above, but the non-locality is real as wavefunction is real. Nature is still weird this way.

Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser.

Collapse happens as per usual, similar to the cases above. The position at D1 and D2 of the detected signal photon determines the probabilities for the idler photon to hit either D3 or D4.

Weakness (Critique): It doesn’t conserve energy! It modified Schrödinger equation to be non-unitary, so quantum information and probabilities are not conserved as well. Nature goes wonky if this is true.

Strength: In comparison to consciousness causes collapse, those who hold the view of materialism breath easier at seeing the observer’s role being phased out of quantum physics. The weakness of having constantly adding energy to the universe (although at a small enough level that people haven’t noticed it yet) is turned into a strength if we regard it as an explanation for dark energy\[[https://landing.newscientist.com/department-for-education-feature-3/](https://landing.newscientist.com/department-for-education-feature-3/)

\], well it has the wrong sign so it actually makes the universe wanna come back together rather than expand. The main strength is that these are actually alternative theories which can be tested and proposed experiments are doable in the near future.

Sidenote: Roger Penrose who in 2020 won a Nobel prize for black holes, is not concerned with Black hole information paradox due to the collapse of wavefunction according to him, already destroys quantum information conservation. It seems that only those who maintain that in principle there can be a universal wavefunction (and maybe no collapse too) might worry about such thing as Black holes don’t seem to conserve information.

Question about the double split experiment,1605227771,"If someone could explain if this makes any sense or that I am completely wrong and explain why I am wrong, I would really appreciate that. 

So here is the explanation of the double split experiment:

[Double Slit Experiment explained! by Jim Al-Khalili](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9tKncAdlHQ&amp;t=11s)

So my theory is that when they shoot one particle at a time and do not record a slit they see an interference pattern on te back wall, because the particle moves as a probability wave function ( it moves as a wave because it keeps all the possible actions open). The reason it stops doing so once recorded is because it moves in a wave function, that wave function resembles a different dimension, that we humans cannot comprehend and every time we look at it or start to record it we cannot record every probability so it becomes just one, which causes it to behave like a particle and results in two lines on the back wall.

SO what I am suggesting is that one of the dimensions that exist but we do not see is the dimension of probability. And the particle moving in such a dimension is a some sort of wave function because it keeps all the possibilities open. And once we in any way want to record or perceive what the particle is doing the wave function collapse and becomes one of the many possibilities, thus making the movement particle like, rather than wave like.",Physics,ROMT98,False,/r/Physics/comments/jt70ca/question_about_the_double_split_experiment/

What Is a Particle?,1605203414,"&gt;Given that everything in the universe reduces to particles, a question presents itself: What are particles?  
&gt;  
&gt;The easy answer quickly shows itself to be unsatisfying. Namely,  electrons, photons, quarks and other “fundamental” particles supposedly  lack substructure or physical extent. “We basically think of a particle  as a pointlike object,” said [Mary Gaillard](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/mary-k-gaillard),  a particle theorist at the University of California, Berkeley who  predicted the masses of two types of quarks in the 1970s. And yet  particles have distinct traits, such as charge and mass. How can a  dimensionless point bear weight?  
&gt;  
&gt;“We say they are ‘fundamental,’” said [Xiao-Gang Wen](https://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/wen_xiao-gang.html),  a theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  “But that’s just a \[way to say\] to students, ‘Don’t ask! I don’t know  the answer. It’s fundamental; don’t ask anymore.’”  
&gt;  
&gt;With any other object, the object’s properties depend on its physical  makeup — ultimately, its constituent particles. But those particles’  properties derive not from constituents of their own but from  mathematical patterns. As points of contact between mathematics and  reality, particles straddle both worlds with an uncertain footing.

Is it possible to learn math + physic like learning to write a program? (concept heavy subject),1605173162,"If you feel the need to close the post, please at least read the whole post, I really think it will be very useful for other people.

&amp;#x200B;

I am a programmer, and my personal believe is that math math should not be hard to ""understand."" by understand I mean you can absorb the concept.   
So with my definition of ""understanding,"" it is not required you to be able to proof, or derived math equations from certain theorem, or apply them.   


think of it like you are a chess newbie and know all the basic stuff, and you are watching, says, video of chess match between professional. In this case, you understand what is happening on the board after a move is made  (eg. checkmate), but you are incapable of making the ""correct"" move before the move is made.  


Similarly in math, i think, it should be possible to just ""understand"" the concept of certain equation, even though you are incapable of using it in anyway. I guess its like knowing just intuition but not the math. 

okay, let me get to the point,

with this minimum requirement, I am wondering is it possible to learn math like learning to write a program. 

&amp;#x200B;

program is similar to math concept in that ""concept"" build upon each other. (program build upon ""class"", ""variable"", ""function"", etc. and math concept build ""premise"", ""theorem"", ""definition"", etc)  


Example of step to learn to write a program.

1. I want to understand how to use method A
2. I read method A and but I don't understand what variable B is used for
3. I check how variable B is used
4. Now I understand how variable A is used.

step provide above is pretty obvious in programming and it should applied to learning math concept too, but the problem is programming ""concept"" is searchable, but math ""concept"" is not required to be searchable (\[ \] may mean different things in different math field).  


another reason that above step is difficult to apply in math compared to programming is because math lack ""validation steps"" (a step to validate degree in which you understand the concept.) In programming, if function don't run, you don't get it. if function doesn't do what you want, you don't get it, and you don't even need to read the function line by line neither because it simply compute for you. However, in math, I is hard to even tell what you don't understand and also hard to test if you are not comfortable working with math (No way to just run the ""concept"" to test you understanding)  


so I give myself a challenge to understand a research paper that I have absolutely no clue about, and see if I can understand it. This implies that I can skip things that doesn't help me to understand the higher level, such as theorem's proof. (in case concept that I care is built upon this theorem.)   


My current difficulty is searching for certain math notation given a context. (eg. even if I know what operation A is, but if i don't know its symbol, it wouldn't know that it is operation A; aka, operation A is searable, but its symbol is not searchable)

here is the paper for my challenge: 

 **Universal Invariant and Equivariant Graph Neural Networks** [https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/ea9268cb43f55d1d12380fb6ea5bf572-Paper.pdf](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/ea9268cb43f55d1d12380fb6ea5bf572-Paper.pdf)  


 so far i am doing okay, I understand what the paper is saying in higher level, I will pass the test of ""understand"" if I can do the following  
1. write essay with minimum equation explaining what the paper is trying to solve, what is the usecase of it, what the concept is about?

2. I can still recall the concept with in the paper, and ""reuse"" them in the future. (""reuse"" means I understand general concept rather than per use case basis)

3. at any point in time in the future if I need to learn ""lower"" level concept, I can simply fill out the blank like pluging in lower level concept into a bigger one. (nothing is changed; same shape but less hole)

It is worth noting that I do have note taking system to allow for point 2, 3, but what I am doing here is to create a framework to learn math in such a way that my current note taking system can be applied.

why am I doing this?

1. no need to learn math from book. like reading chapter 1, 2, 3... next book,..
2. learning is more fun. (project based learning (eg. understand certain paper) . rather than ""just learn"")
3. learning can be ""paused and resumed""
4. learning is adhoc. (only learn when i need to)",Physics,awannaphasch2016,False,/r/Physics/comments/jsrqyr/is_it_possible_to_learn_math_physic_like_learning/

Absolute Frame Of Reference,1605169204,"I have considered a case in my head where we make an assumption that our universe is a simulation.

With that in mind, would it be possible to create an absolute frame of reference where it is one set outside of our universe.

For example, we know that time slows down near black holes, and if we ever found ourselves near one, we would experience time normally, however someone watching from distance would see us moving very slowly. 

Could we not create a Frame Of Refrence from outside our universe where both of these are ""true"".


Technically the person near the black hole would simply be in the area of simulation that has a lot of information to process and is therefore ""updating"" slower, than the area where the second distant observer is, which is ""updating"" faster. Essentially the ""computer"" that is running the simulation has a limitation on how fast it can process information, therefore in those areas of high mass(information) density, it has to slow down in order to do so.

The person who is inside that area, does not notice the fact that they are ""updating"" more slowly, due to the fact that the area as whole is doing so, and they are simply part of the simulation. 
They only notice that objects outside of that area ""update"" faster however.

Now if we had a third observer, set outside the universe, could they not  see the whole universe and be used as an absolute frame of reference?

Also, assuming this theory is plausible, do you believe it would be possible to determine the speed of such a ""computer"" from inside the simulation by measuring the rate at which the simulation updates slower in areas of high information density?",Physics,Deedrinerus_1717,False,/r/Physics/comments/jsr1us/absolute_frame_of_reference/

I'm a university student in the US - just transferred to Physics after three years in Aerospace Engineering. I'm much happier and so excited to follow this path.

When speaking with my advisor about my school's Bachelor-Accelerated Master's program (BAM), she suggested it's more worthwhile to jump straight into my PhD after receiving my bachelor's degree.

When looking at other schools though, particularly abroad, it seemed that most if not all required a master's degree for a PhD program. My partner mentioned that (1) there will likely be few exceptions with how competitive grad school is; (2) spending time in a master's program will give me more experience to narrow down my intended area of research.

Frustrating stuff,1605141039,"I'm in AP Physics 2 and we just had our second test in electricity over electric potentials and other stuff(We weren't able to cover electricity in physics 1 due to COVID). Out the 15 multiple choice, around 4 of them involved finding information regarding electric field/potential in some region of a parallel plate capacitor. What was really upsetting to me I had no clue if I had to use the approximation that electric fields are the same between these plates or not. I'm assuming I had to because the calculations would be pretty complicated otherwise but some questions gave me really detailed information regarding the location where they wanted to me to find the electrical field, and so I felt a bit uneasy about using this approximation. 

We also had many free responses which pretty much involve finding the acceleration/final speed of an electron released from rest between these capacitors with the disclaimer that we should ignore special relativity. I however very rarely see the disclaimer that electric field is NOT constant throughout this situation mentioned. If force is inversely correlated with radius squared then I have to think that acceleration gets increasingly high as a particle approaches these plates? I'm not complaining about the fact that we make these approximations, but rather about the fact that it is never mentioned that these are indeed approximations. I hate to mention this, but I am likely one of the smarter students in Physics 2 and it's pretty sad that most students never question this and likely develop some incorrect knowledge about how electric forces in a parallel plate capacitor works.(I definitely don't have a college degree, so if I make any mistakes please correct me too). Even worse honestly is that my Physics teacher pretty much copies all his questions from official college board material he has access to - so the fact that such an important institution in learning is not educating students correctly is concerning.

I would love to have some hard evidence to disprove him, even though I know he will call it fake. Here's the ""challenge"" he sent me. It's a lot to read, but is so bonkers I don't even know were to begin unpacking it. I'm sorry if this is the wrong sub for this, but I thought you guys would be the best source for this.   


  

""Science - our desire and our ability to obtain a better understanding of the natural and physical world in which we live through observation and experiment.

Scientist - literally anyone who dutifully practices the Scientific Method, disregards any biased information as “fact” until absolutely proven, remains ultra skeptical of any “Scientific Facts” or conclusions that they did not come to based on their own observations and experiments and is always completely absent of all unproven assumptions.

**1.** The Scientific Method is as follows:

A. Observation: Be alive. Then, use your senses to observe the natural and physical world in which we live.

B. Hypothesis: Have thoughts. Then, make predictions, guesses and contemplations about any phenomenon that you experience with your senses.

C. Experiment: Perform tests or experiments to see if your Observations and Hypothesis coincide logically. If your experiment fails try again, perhaps with a new Hypothesis.

D. Conclusions based on Data: Gather the data recorded from your experiments to form a general theory about the natural and physical world you observe. Eventually, based on enough non-biased, assumption-free experimental data, we may come to form agreed conclusions or theories, Scientific Facts, or even Laws of Nature. For example: The Law of Density.

**2.** Scientific Facts are measurable, observable, tangible, practical pieces of information and data that can be drawn from experiments that can be conducted, reproduced and repeated again and again.

**3.** If you are basing your reality on information or “Scientific Facts” that were not accumulated through observation and experiment (Scientific Method) then you are actually basing your reality on pseudoscience.

**4.** If you have a claim that may not be tested using the Scientific Method, then you are a proponent of pseudoscience.

**5.** If your experiments to test your hypothesis fail over and over again, **then your hypothesis is** **wrong** and you must start over in your approach to reach a truly scientific theory.

**6.** If you are practicing mathematics with no practical, observable application to the natural and physical world, it is an implication of pseudoscience. It is also an implication that your mathematics are of a false paradigm or reality.

**7.** Science has no ability to prove Absolute Truth, only Absolute Falsity. The only Absolute Truth is your own Self-Actualized, Self-Accepted Truth. If you have no ability to obtain the Self Truth, try the Scientific Method (Look at it and think about it).

**8.** Hierarchical Bias is not Science. “Because another person said.” does not qualify as experimental data. Another person’s word, no matter their Education, should never be a determining factor in your Self Truth, especially if your observations and senses tell you otherwise.

**Challenge:** If you disagree with the framework of any of the guidelines listed above please be very specific in why. Be sure to include the names of the experiments (and “scientific facts” that have been concluded from these experiments) that are out of compliance with the listed guidelines. Again, please be very specific.

Claims:

**1.** The dimensions of the Earth are 7917.5 miles in diameter and 24,901 miles in circumference: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**2.** The Earth is moving at all, much less spinning on its axis at 1,014 mph, rotating around the Sun at 66,600 mph and moving furthermore through Outer Space at a velocity of up to 1,000,000+ mph: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**3.** The distance from the surface of the Earth to any observable star in the sky is greater than a 4-digit number in miles: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**4.** The distance from the surface of the Earth to the sun is 92.96 million miles: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**5.** The distance from the surface of the Earth to the Moon is 238,900 miles: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**6.** The Sun and the Moon are different sizes: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**7.** The light being emitted from the Moon is a reflection of sunlight: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**8.** The Moon causes tides: FALSE. PSEUDOSCIENCE.

**Challenge:**

Use any and all resources available to you (NASA, Gov’t, personal life experience, Corporate News sources, Wikipedia, your own observations and experiments…) to prove any lack of falsity in any of the claims above. Please be sure that any and all information you provide is in compliance with the standards of the basic guidelines of science previously presented. (If you disagree with any of the guidelines you should not have made it this far.)

**Example:** If you think the Sun actually is 92.96 million miles away, how did you or anyone you assume to be a Scientist come to arrive at these calculations and conclusions? Please be very specific and assumption free. Good luck!""",Physics,cubanesis,False,/r/Physics/comments/jsba8m/seeking_help_with_a_flat_earth_family_member/

Extremely toxic behavior by physics mods,1605050935,"I have reported this issue to Reddit but for the young people here who are learning physics, please be aware that consensus driven physics is totally corrupted. I have a few points I want to make quickly without writing a book (because I certainly could with what I’ve been through).

I made this post to r/askphysics which resulted in a ban: https://www.instagram.com/p/CHazZ7aHXIA/?igshid=yh0zbg2unlnv

The mods went on to say I had ‘mental illness’ over the post (they’ve had a history of name calling me mentally ill names like schizophrenic). This is so toxic and wrong of them.

First off, someone with mental illness isn’t non-intelligent and they seem to be promoting all the stereotypes of mental illness when they name call at me. Second off, how on earth can a physicists diagnose someone through Reddit? It’s not even their profession yet it’s the very thing they bring up when people not with a physics degree discuss complex physics topics.

In addition, all I did was politely bring up the question of Oleg Jefimenko and his theory of relativity asking why he didn’t receive a noble prize for his work in ‘electromagnetic retardation and theory of relativity’.

There’s thing whole thing I’ve come to learn called the ‘crackpot index’ which essentially states nobody can disprove Einstein and his colleagues and essentially humanity has reached apex evolution and there’s nothing revolutionary which will replace Einstein’s relativity, only be built on top of it or tweaked.

The irony of all this is they excommunicate people the same way the church did a few thousand years ago for bringing up different views. This absolutely has nothing to do with ‘who’s smarter’ and that argument is getting really old. I also have been in therapy almost all my life (ironically for having difficulty in slow paced classes) and I’ve skipped grades. The therapist has seen the messages they’ve sent me and have said this is absolutely unacceptable and I should ignore them.

The topic of physics has become so spoon fed and dogma oriented, there’s literally no way someone like Jefimenko could replace Einstein. How could he if they don’t even bother reading his books and dismiss it as ‘crackpot’.

What’s also strange is physicists will bring up the term ‘gravitoelectromagnetism’ yet this term has never been used in Jefimenko’s books so I have absolutely no clue what they’re going on about.

Solution to measuring the speed of light in one specific direction,1605037655,"I'm just going to get right into it.  


So I believe I may have found a way to calculate the lightspeed in one specific direction  
Here's how it would work.  


Box A is in the middle, box C is one lightsecond to the left, and box B is one lightsecond to the right.  
This means it should take light 4 seconds to get from box C to B and back. Now send light from point C to B and back but through a glass box. This shows how much the glass decreases the lightspeed.  
I've found on the internet it makes the lightspeed about 2/3th of what it is in a vacuüm, but for better accuracy you do the experiment yourself with the same glass box you intend to use later on.  


So, now we got those values, now send a lightsignal from A to C. When C observes the light start a timer. At the exact same time you've sent a signal from A to C, also send one from A to B, when it reaches B send a signal to C, when that reaches C stop the timer. This should mean the timer stops with a result of 2 seconds (Starts after 1 second, stops after 3)  


Now do the same thing but with a glass box below box A, which causes the lightspeed from B to C to decrease. Now, by calculating the difference between the end results of the timers, you should be able to easily calculate how much time it took for the light to get from B to C, therefor you have found how fast lightspeed is in a specific direction  


  
I haven't found any flaws in it yet, if you find some please point them out to me. If you haven't please share so others can see this, since if there are no flaws in it it might just be helpful for science!

Universes are Alive!,1605030042,"I used to think physicists were the most rational, the most intelligent and so on and would not stoop to dogma.

Smolin in his book catalogued how physicists put all their efforts into string theory and practically excluded everything else for 30 years despite the fact that it was not giving predictions for experiments.

Smolin also had a theory that universes that have a lot of black holes reproduce more and are more likely to support life making universes subject to evolutionary theory. I thought then why not go all the way and suppose universes are life and particles are baby universes which is also life -- then of course life would exist in all universes that are reproducing.

Explanation of the Interference Patterns of Light by the Particle Model ( Part 1 ),1604919357,"# Introduction

Thomas Young, speaking on 24 November 1803, to the Royal Society of London, began his now-classic description of the historic experiment: 

&gt;*The experiments I am about to relate ... may be repeated with great ease, whenever the sun shines, and without any other apparatus than is at hand to every one.* 

Young describes an experiment where he placed a card about 0.85 millimeter thick into a light beam from a single opening in a window and observed the fringes of color in the shadow .

After this experiment, which had great repercussions in the scientific world, Newton's century-old view that light is a particle, expressed in the book Opticks, was brought up for discussion. And so, perhaps the most important discussion of physics, ""Is light a wave or a particle?"" discussion has begun.

After the double slit experiment, the idea that light consists of waves was confirmed; But, The question ""What is the wave?"" was not answered.

Physics theories of the late 19th century assumed that surface water waves must have a medium in order to move, which is water. Likewise, sound waves needed air to propagate. Therefore, light had to need a medium, ""ether"", to transmit its wave motions. Since light can travel through a vacuum, it was assumed that even vacuum must be filled with ether.

Two physicists named Albert Abraham Michelson and Edward W. Morley prepared an experiment in 1881 to prove the ether experimentally.

The main idea of the experiment was this; The Earth rotates around the Sun at about 30 km / s, and according to the stationary aether hypotheses, the Earth and the aether are in relative motion, indicating that the ""ether wind"" must exist. Therefore, if a beam of light is sent against the ether wind, the light should slow down (c-v), but if it is sent in the other direction, the light should accelerate (c + v). In other words, the doppler effect had to be observed.

If a light source is moving away from an observer, a redshift occurs; blue shift occurs if the source moves towards the observer. This applies to all electromagnetic waves and is explained by the doppler effect.

However, ether is not required to observe the Doppler effect. If we assume that there is no ether and that light propagates in space and use Galilean Space-Time transformations, we do the same calculations again and we come to the conclusion that there must be a phase shift due to the delay. In other words, the Michelson-Morley experiment does not prove neither the existence nor the absence of ether. 

With or without ether, according to the experimental result, in all cases there should have been a phase shift due to the doppler effect. But the expected phase shift never happened. This was the main thing that surprised scientists. After this experiment, the physics understanding of ""absolute time and variable speed of light"" was switched to ""absolute speed of light and relative time"". In fact, scientists have tried to explain why the expected doppler effect is not caused by the understanding of ""absolute speed of light and relative time"".

Everyone was so sure that the bright and dark fringes on the interferometer were caused by interference in light waves, that no one had thought that it could be anything but interference. Perhaps the Michelson-Morley experiment was actually proving that the  bright and dark fringes were not caused by interference.

Let's take the subject from a different perspective and examine how the seeing phenomenon occurs biologically; In our eye, the retinal molecules (11-cis-retinal) in Rod and Cone cells absorb the photon with the appropriate energy and flatten into the all-trans-retinal configuration.

In Experiments, we learned that when an atom or molecule absorbs a photon, its electrons can move to higher-energy orbitals, and the atom or molecule makes a transition to a higher-energy state. In retinal, absorption of a photon promotes a **π** electron to a higher-energy orbital (a **π**\-**π**\* excitation). This excitation ""breaks"" the **π** component of the double bond, thus allowing free rotation about the bond between carbon atom 11 and carbon atom 12 (see Figure 1.0). Thus, when 11-cis-retinal absorbs a photon in the visible range of the spectrum, free rotation about the bond between carbon atom 11 and carbon atom 12 can occur and the all-trans-retinal can form. 

&amp;#x200B;

`Figure 1.0 -  Absorption of a photon in the visible range, 11-cis-retinal can isomerize to all-trans-retinal.` 

&amp;#x200B;

If the bright and dark fringes in the double slit experiment were caused by interference, we would not be able to see these fringes. Because, in our eyes, the mechanism that enables light to transform into electro-chemical signals was not designed to convert these waves into signals. The system is based on absorbing the photon and raising the **π** electron to a higher energy orbit. In other words, the seeing mechanism is not designed to convert waves that emanate from a single source and propagate like water waves into signals.

In order for us to see the bright and dark fringes, photons in the light region must be reflected on the screen and absorbed by retinal molecules in our eyes.

# Interference and Diffraction

Two centuries after Thomas Young, with the development of technology, an experimental system that sends photons to the screen one by one was developed and the Young experiment was repeated. Surprisingly, in the double slit experiment, the same interference patterns occurred when individual photons were sent to the slits (see Figure 1.1).

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.1](https://preview.redd.it/dvxqr08zfux51.jpg?width=600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52aa797aa41f698422937cf11baa8170d0867061)

`Figure 1.1`

&amp;#x200B;

As shown in Figure 1.1, a photon leaves a trace at only one point on the screen. But as time passes, the traces left by tens of thousands of photons on the screen create interference patterns.

In 1989, the company hitachi sent electrons to the slits one by one in an interference experiment, and again, bright and dark fringes appeared, as in Young's experiment. At different times, these experiments were also tested with neutrons, atoms, and even molecules, and bright-dark interference patterns occured each time.

The explanation that while passing through slits, particles produce copies of themselves and interfere with them is against the conservation of energy, which is the 1st law of Thermodynamics. No photon, electron, atom or molecule can create its own copy from nothing. This explanation is against thermodynamics.

Since bright-dark fringes occur when we send the particles to the slits one by one, this must be due to something else, not interference. To find the answer to this question, we will take a look at the Stern-Gerlach experiment.

With the experiment carried out by Otto Stern and Walther Gerlach in 1922, we have gained more information about the magnetic moments of electrons. The Stern–Gerlach experiment involves sending a beam of silver atoms through an inhomogeneous magnetic field and observing their deflection. I will talk about a very interesting analogy between the Young and Stern-Gerlach experiments.

I will develop a new experimental system based on the Stern-Gerlach experiment. Front and side view of the Stern-Gerlach Experiment System can be seen in Figure 1.2. In the experimental system I will create, I will use its side view. For the sake of simplicity, I will call it the ""*SG experiment setup*"" instead of the Stern-Gerlach.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 3qzvey7krvx51...*

`Figure 1.2 - Front (a) and side (b) views of the ""Stern-Gerlach test setup""`

Also, I will name the deflection angles of the particles as + α and -α in the SG experiment.

Suppose we put two SG experimental setups side by side (see Figure 1.3). Particles deviating from the 1st SG experimental setup with an angle of ± α will have a deflection angle of ± 2α after leaving the 2nd SG experimental setup. For each SG experimental setup added, an α angle is added.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.3 - Two SG experiment setups](https://preview.redd.it/mygbs4lpvvx51.jpg?width=476&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=653694da1991cdfe63694108da5091424d2c3382)

`Figure 1.3 - Two SG experiment setups`

If we reverse the 2nd SG experimental setup (see Figure 1.4); In the 1st SG experimental setup, the particle deflecting upward with an angle of + α deviates downward with an angle -α after the 2nd SG experimental setup, and hence + α and -α cancel each other out. In other words, when the particle leaves the SG experimental system , it continues to move in a direction parallel to the x axis. Likewise, in the 1st SG experimental setup, the particle deflecting downward by -α angle deviates upward with the angle + α in the 2nd SG experimental setup, and therefore + α and -α cancel each other out.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.4 - Opposite SG setups.](https://preview.redd.it/mlqaqeczk1y51.jpg?width=422&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b807ed17d95a63e1f97c7d35791f5cc43fd97bc7)

`Figure 1.4 - Opposite SG setups.`

In other words, the particle continues to move in a direction parallel to the x axis at an angle of 0 degrees. Since the 1st and 2nd SG experimental setups are opposite to each other, there is no deviation when the particles exit the system. 

If we do not know the magnetic field direction in SG experimental setups, we calculate all the possibilities in both setups. As a result, 3 paths occur; + 2α, 0, and -2α. (see Figure 1.5)

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.5 - All the paths the particle can go](https://preview.redd.it/t1lu8o5u42y51.jpg?width=565&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c90bb6605294e89b9b45d84b0ce72ae9f57af9c3)

`Figure 1.5 - All the ways the particle can go`

Note: The system consisting of more than one ""SG experiment setup"" is called ""SG experiment system"" in the rest of the article.

Let's add a 3rd SG experimental setup to the SG experimental system (see Figure 1.6) and calculate the paths the particles can follow. When all are in the same direction, the Particles deflect up by an angle of + 3α or down by an angle of -3α. They deviate by an alpha angle in each SG experimental setup they pass. If one or both of the SG experimental setups are in opposite directions, the particles deflect up or down by an angle ± α.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.6 - Triple SG experiment system](https://preview.redd.it/wa0mi1t262y51.jpg?width=619&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f99f97caaca8f5c2d51fc038530af073d64e70a7)

`Figure 1.6 - Triple SG experiment system`

When we calculate all the probabilities, 4 separate paths emerge. ± 3α and ± α. 

Based on all this information, let's develop a larger experiment consisting of N sets of SG experiment setups (see Figure 1.7). The number of paths that particles are likely to follow through this system will be equal to N + 1. Deviation angles continue as 0, ± α, ± 2α, ± 3α… ± Nα.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.7 - N pieces of SG experiment setup](https://preview.redd.it/ad214ux482y51.jpg?width=987&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09ae166050b622d728d16d8f9cff6edb8b5e5ec4)

`Figure 1.7 - N pieces of SG experiment setup`

**Which path and how often do particles pass?** In order to make calculations, I simulated the SG experiment system in computer environment and experimented with 1 million particles. Different SG experiment system was created for each particle and random N (N &lt;= 50) SG experimental setups were created in each experimental system.

For example, 47 SG experimental setups for the 1st particle were placed side by side and the magnetic field direction of each SG setup was randomly generated up or down. For the 2nd particle, 36 SG experimental setups were placed side by side and again the magnetic field direction of each SG setup was randomly generated up or down. This process was repeated 1 million times. A graph like in Figure 1.8 appeared.

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.8 - Density Distribution of particles](https://preview.redd.it/u08876k892y51.png?width=709&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a4df8028ebe6ac95ecc20265295ae5a4ef87769)

`Figure 1.8 - Scatter plot of particles`

As can be seen in Figure 1.8, the density distribution of the paths followed by the particles in the simulation of the SG experiment system is similar to the density distribution of the paths followed by photons in Young's experiment (see Figure 1.9).

&amp;#x200B;

[Figure 1.9](https://preview.redd.it/3rrxij1aa2y51.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5885b08af27fb33448c4bb9fea1d081f659deacf)

`Figure 1.9`

Figure 1.9 shows N SG experimental setups, the paths of the particles passing through this system and the density distribution of the particles passing through these paths.

In the double slit experiment, the effect of the slits on light is neglected and only the properties of the light is taken into account. But when we examine the surface of the slit that appears neutral, we see opposing electric and magnetic fields that differ in atomic size.

In imaging techniques such as AFM (Atomic Force Microscpe), STM (Scanning Tunneling Microscope), MFM (Magnetic Force Microscope), these atomic-sized electrostatic and magnetostatic forces on the surface are used. These imaging techniques have shown us that when we consider surfaces on a micro scale, we cannot think of them as one-piece neutral as in classical physics.

Since all electrostatic and magnetostatic forces on the surface act simultaneously on macro objects, the resultant of the total forces becomes 0 and the macro objects pass through the slits without being affected.

But only one of these forces acts on nanoparticles at a particular time and location. Not all of them act at the same time.

For example, when an electron travels close to the surface, it is affected by either positive charges or only negative charges on the surface at a certain location. Thus, the electrostatic force either moves the electron away from the surface or brings it closer to the surface. As the electron moves across the surface, the direction of the electrostatic force constantly changes. As in the SG experimental system above, the forces acting along the path change direction. These forces act on the particle randomly and in succession along the path, and deviations occur in the path of the particle according to a certain order. The cumulative sum of these paths, on the other hand, causes the particles to concentrate in certain areas, resulting in bright-dark patterns.

A situation similar to the SG experiment system above occurs between the slit surfaces and the photons. Each photon passes through a path close to the surface and is under the influence of different electrostatic and magnetostatic forces. Either both or only one of these forces act on the photons, causing the paths of the photons to change.

Interpretations of quantum,1604912788,"I am in the middle of writing a popular account (little to no maths) of the various interpretations of quantum, including all the ones in this Wikipedia table, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations\_of\_quantum\_mechanics#cite\_note-61](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretations_of_quantum_mechanics#cite_note-61)  


I have introduced double-slit, Stern Gerlach, Bell's test and Delayed choice quantum eraser as the 4 main experiments to be interpreted and seen in light of each interpretation. As for thought experiments, Schrödinger's cat is my go to example in brief introduction to the interpretations. 

There's several ones which has very little information on how exactly to apply it to the experiments and what's the story they give to the maths of quantum. Eg. Time-symmetric theories, Stochastic interpretation, Many minds interpretation, Quantum logic (is modal interpretation part of quantum logic?) 

Can anyone help to point out good resources to investigate all these? I have a bachelor's degree in physics.   


Here's what I got for the brief introduction to the interpretations of quantum so far, if there's any error, please do comment thanks. Do refer to the table in the wiki link to get the various properties of the interpretations. 

Interpretations are those which just changes the story and how to interpret the same maths. A modification or alternative theory is one where the maths is changed a bit to fit in their story of how quantum works. Those which changes/ modify the axioms of quantum maybe thought of as either interpretation or another theory. Interpretations are in principle not testable to differentiate between them as they have the same maths, same prediction, just different ways to tell the story. Those with modified maths can be in principle tested experimentally, once we got to those levels of experimental sophistication, currently we don’t cannot tell the difference between them and standard quantum formulation. Thus, we lump them in here. Those with modified axioms may or may not proposed a testable way to differentiate them. I wouldn’t be so strict in classifying which is which, as it’s only more important to physics, and we’re doing more philosophy here. 

Copenhagen, the one you’ve been seeing so many times before now. It’s hard to give an accurate account of what this interpretation says because it was promoted by many people and different people have slightly different take on it, and even Relational interpretation and QBism interpretation are said to be Copenhagen done right. 

This is the default mode interpretation for most physicists when they first started learning quantum. It contains minimal story elements, mainly due to the rejection of ontic wavefunction, that is wavefunction is not taken to be really existing. With regards to the choice of non-locality vs counterfactual definiteness to discard when facing with Bell’s inequality violation, this interpretation happily throws out reality in favour of being local. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, there’s criticism that the concept of collapse of wavefunction alone implies non locality. See for example the double-slit experiment. Let’s make it that the screen is light years away from the double-slit, the size of the screen is also light years wide. When the electron wavefunction reaches the screen, there’s a possibility for the electron to appear in many points across light years. When the electron hits the screen and the wavefunction of the electron which gives probability of it appearing anywhere on the screen collapses immediately as we register a definite position for the electron on the screen. The collapse is non-local because it’s immediate. Everywhere else across light years, the wavefunction collapses to update that there is zero possibility to find the electron at those places. Einstein brought this idea up as his special relativity imposes locality on nature. I am presenting a modified version. The Copenhagen interpretation wave this away and points back to the notion that we don’t take wavefunction to be real. No to ontic wavefunction. However nature does this we cannot ask. All we have is merely the tools to calculate the probabilities distribution function. 

&amp;#x200B;

So indeed, if you go back to the table listing the interpretations and the characteristics, if there is yes to collapsing wavefunction and yes to ontic wavefunction, then there must be no to local dynamics. 

&amp;#x200B;

This interpretation also just straight up accepts the axioms presented earlier in the maths part, and introduced some new quantum principles like the uncertainty principle, wave-particle duality, complementary principle, correspondence principle, quantum jump, superposition of wavefunction etc to give the classical thinkers some way to get a handle on how to expect  the quantum world to behave without doing the maths first. Some of the principles contradicts the properties that other interpretation has, so I refrained from using them too much so as not to overly taint a bad view of those interpretations which denies these principles. In other quantum books, you maybe already been exposed to them as a given. If you like, the story of this interpretation are basically these quantum principles. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the axioms is that the wavefunction is a complete description of a quantum system. Thus this interpretation also says no to hidden variables. So this is the main classical interpretation which straight up denies reality in three fronts: wavefunction is not real, merely a tool for calculation, no hidden variables and properties of objects not observed do not exist. Bohr even coined a principle for it called the complementary principle (eg. measuring position means no accurate momentum). When people often compare Buddhism to quantum it is this interpretation which they usually implies, as there are clear denial of reality, it seems to harmonise very well with emptiness, empty of inherent essence. 

&amp;#x200B;

Due to no underlying reality, the probabilistic outcome of experiments are taken to be intrinsically random and determinism is rejected. The observer plays a central role in the collapse of wavefunction. The quantum system is one thing, described by the wavefunction, then the measurement apparatus and observer are another thing, assumed to be classical as we experience the world classically. 

&amp;#x200B;

When quantum wavefunction meets measurement, collapse of wavefunction happens, results are probabilistic. The interpretation like the maths does not specify at which limit is the cut from quantum to classical. The so called Heisenberg cut. The observer has the causal role of performing the measurements, of choosing which measurements to do. For the reason of requiring classical parts of measurement to link to experimental observation, there’s no such thing as universal wavefunction for this interpretation. And unique history is not an issue as there’s no interpretation back then to challenge this concept. So now all nine properties are briefly discussed. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of the nine, seven of them are against preferred classical notions. Only unique history and local dynamics are in accordance to classical sensibilities. Thus Copenhagen interpretation accepts the magic of quantum on stage at face value, that nature really is like this down to the fundamental level. No underlying mechanism, no backstage. It’s no wonder that so many regard quantum as weird, it’s actually Copenhagen interpretation that’s weird. So many people have problems with this interpretation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Problems with this interpretation are the ones which generated a lot of different other interpretations to either address some of the problems here or to firm the Copenhagen interpretation up to discard these problems.

&amp;#x200B;

Discontinuous jumps when there is an observation. When observing the position of an electron at one moment, we get from Heisenberg uncertainty relations that the momentum becomes more uncertain, then we observe the position of the electron a few moments later, we cannot tell for certain the path the electron takes in between the observations, because to have a path means to have continuous exact position and momentum of the particle at the same time. There’s no underlying mechanics to quantum mechanics, hence the bad naming of the field. Also, this interpretation just covers this up by applying a label called quantum jump (technically only for electrons in atomic orbitals). This can be seen as objection to no counterfactual definiteness. 

The probabilistic element introduced upon observation. To many physicists, this is giving up causality. Since given the same cause and conditions, different results appear, and this interpretation insists that this is fundamental, no backstage, no hidden variables, nothing underneath, how can causality be preserved?

The subjectiveness of requiring an observer. Classical physics assumes reality can exist independent of us. Why should quantum not be the same? Many interpretations make special effort to make sure that observes doesn’t play a role. 

The difficulty of defining a measuring device, the necessity of invoking classical physics to describe the ""laboratory"" in which the results are measured. At what point does the wavefunction collapse? Aren’t the measuring device made up of atoms too? Since atoms obey quantum rules, why shouldn’t quantum effects in principle go all the way up, maybe to even cover the whole universe? Why is there no such concept as a universal wavefunction in this interpretation? The famous Schrödinger's cat is an example to show how absurd this might be. The cat is placed in a box with a poison triggered by radioactive decay governed by quantum process. Within an hour, there’s a 50% change for the radioactive decay to trigger the poison release and 50% that it did not. So the cat in the meantime, before observation is in the superposition state of dead and alive. Only in observation (by opening the box) can we collapse the wavefunction of the cat to verify if the cat is still alive. We don’t see superposition at all, how far up the macroscopic world can quantum go? I shall do the Schrödinger's cat’s example for the interpretations below to show briefly what it means. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, the objections are quite predictable, mainly attachments to one or another of the classical concepts. So the game of interpretations or game of theories as coined by Jim Baggott is the game where you get to choose which classical concepts you hold dear and develop the interpretations based on it. No interpretation can tick all classical boxes, so it’s pick and choose time. 

&amp;#x200B;

The more detailed description of each interpretation will be given in their own section along with their interpretations of what happens in various quantum experiments. This is more of a touch and go, brief overview. Note that many of these interpretations has minor variance in them, I shall just group them together. 

&amp;#x200B;

Let’s go for wild. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everett’s many worlds interpretation. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is the one you hear about whenever some popular show involving time travel travels to another world or creates another timeline. Quantum many worlds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everett disliked the notion of wavefunction collapsing. The collapse of wavefunction destroys the nice unitary (preserving information and making sure that probability adds up to 100%) evolution of the nice wavefunction. He claims that his interpretation have the simpler list of things in the theory. Yet, many critique that it’s heavy on many worlds. Essentially, the superposition spreads to the whole universe, there’s such a thing called universal wavefunction and for each quantum measurement which happens, the different results are realized in different worlds. Classically, this means that the wavefunction splits into many worlds, all the time. With the inclusion of multiverse consideration, the quilted multiverse (universe is infinite) would trivially contain the quantum many worlds. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Schrödinger's cat is alive in one world, dead in another, so this solves the puzzle that we never observe a superposition dead or alive cat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Related to many worlds is many minds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Many minds interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

Take note that this is one of the least popular interpretations, so it’s hard to get a grip on what exact it is, especially as it is still in development, much like almost all interpretations here. If I misrepresent this, blame the researchers working on many minds for not producing a non technical, popular version, free to view youtube lecture on it, or an essay aimed at the general audience. Many minds is based on many worlds, it adds the importance of observers, as mind as the role to select why we only see one outcome out of so many worlds. If we take the split into many possibilities as the split of possible minds to observe them rather than actual worlds, that’s basically many minds. It’s part of the class of interpretations without wavefunction collapse, but basically acts like consciousness causes collapse kinda role. Each quantum possibilities are associated with many minds, and we only see one because we only experience one mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Schrödinger's cat I assume would behave like the consciousness causes collapse case, or the many world case, depending on whether or not the many worlds in many minds are real worlds. 

&amp;#x200B;

Related to mind, is the consciousness causes collapse interpretation.

&amp;#x200B;

Consciousness causes collapse 

&amp;#x200B;

The Heisenberg cut problem of the Copenhagen interpretation puts the cut to classical at the latest to the mind. The mind here refers to something utterly not physical, thus not subjected to the quantum rules. In principle, quantum can describe the whole physical universe and not collapse, the only special thing which actualises results, collapse the wavefunction are minds. This answers the problem of what constitutes a measurement in Copenhagen, it is when quantum superposition finally meets the mind does it collapses into classical alternatives. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Schrödinger's cat’s own consciousness can collapse the quantum superposition of the poison apparatus, so actually it was never in superposition. 

&amp;#x200B;

Those who holds onto materialism views dislike this interpretation as it specifically involves the mind in a physical theory. One can also wonder before the first mind gets to be reborn into the universe, how does the universal wavefunction replicate the big bang and other early universe evolution? 

&amp;#x200B;

Here’s some other theories which focuses on collapsing wavefunction.

&amp;#x200B;

Objective collapse theories

&amp;#x200B;

This is a modification of the existing quantum structure to say that the wavefunction is real and via some mechanism or another (there’s a lot of different proposal for this) collapses for real. The Heisenberg cut which determines how large can an object be put into quantum coherence before the objective collapse occurs is stated and thus these theories can be tested and falsified. One of the mechanism proposed is difference and superposition of different gravity or spacetime curvature are the ones causing the collapse to happen objectively. This is in contrast to the consciousness causes collapse interpretation and no universal wavefunction is meaningful here. This kicks out the role of the observer to zero. Even without any minds in the universe, the universe still would function, wavefunction still would collapse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Schrödinger's cat would never be in superposition, the poison mechanism would be also too big to be in superposition, only the radioactive decay is quantum, there’s no mystery here. 

&amp;#x200B;

So far, many of the interpretations are dealing with how to address where the Heisenberg cut is. The distinction between quantum and classical is still there, the many worlds says the quantum wavefunction goes all the way up. The opposite side of it is to bring classical particles, with definite position and momentum all the way down. Here comes the pilot wave theory or Bohmian Mechanics.

&amp;#x200B;

Pilot wave theory

&amp;#x200B;

Despite its name, it’s an interpretation, the mathematics is using the standard one and with some suitable transformation here and there, but still the same maths, we can get the story of both the wave and particles are there! Bohmian mechanics does three things opposite to the Copenhangen interpretation. It accepts wavefunction is real, there’s hidden variables and it accepts counterfactual definiteness, reality is back with a vengeance. The price it pays is that the wavefunction which acts like a pilot wave telling the particles how to move acts faster than light, instantaneously changes according to the changes all around the universe. So this goes around so many of the no go theorems of Bell, Leggett etc on hidden variables, because it is fundamentally a non-local theory. It’s basically surprising that it is one of the first hidden variable theories and still survives all these challenges. 

&amp;#x200B;

If quantum is taught in physics classes with this as the default interpretation, we can recover randomness is a result of ignorance, ignorance of the hidden variables, and almost all the quantum weirdness disappears. 

&amp;#x200B;

What happens to the Schrödinger's cat in this view? The wavefunction can still go into superposition of dead or alive for the cat, but the particles of the cat whether it goes to end up being dead or alive depends on the initial particle position which is a hidden variable from us. The cat is definitely either dead or alive, even before we open the box to look. 

&amp;#x200B;

An early attempt at classical way to look at quantum is the ensemble interpretation.

&amp;#x200B;

Ensemble interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

This is one of the earliest interpretation, also called the statistical interpretation. Einstein preferred this. He likes to think of quantum as half a theory, like thermodynamics is actually statistical mechanics. With the understanding that the macroscopic things we see like temperature is actually the vibration and motions of atoms and molecules. So quantum is like the thermodynamics and the probabilistic results is due to the theory unable to account for the individual things down to the bottom to give rise back to randomness is due to hidden variables. This interpretation can be seen as an early attempt at going back to classical like interpretation of quantum. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ensemble interpretation doesn’t believe that the wavefunction applies to a single particle, but an ensemble of those individual experiments. It doesn’t mean that it cannot be applied to single particles, the probability is still the same calculation, just the interpretation of what does the probability applies to differs. 

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens to Schrödinger's cat here? Easy, the individual cat does not go into superposition, the ensemble interpretation says the probability only applies if you have an ensemble of cats to repeat the experiment, you’ll find half of them dead. This is admittedly more costly in terms of killing cats, do note that these are thought experiments, if ever in the future quantum coherence gets to the level of cats, please don’t do this exact experiment, do things like flip a coin, heads or tails, or superposition of heads and tails. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closely related by very different from this is called the

&amp;#x200B;

Stochastic interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

This arises from some calculations involving Brownian motion of quantum particles being able to derive the Schrödinger’s equation again. Nowadays, it’s developed to indicate that the spacetime quantum foam at the small scales gives rise to quantum, not the other way around as historically assumed. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is a realist interpretation of quantum, so it has counterfactual definiteness and hidden variables in the quantum foam. So presumably, Schrödinger's cat was never in superposition and always have a definite value of aliveness. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given so many interpretation tries to get back to classical sense, how about taking the experiments seriously and not be bounded by classical logic? Maybe the fault is not in nature, but in our attachment to classical logic which makes us want to interpret quantum classically, thus the study of a new logic called quantum logic is born. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quantum logic

&amp;#x200B;

Normal logic says one thing cannot posses the property of one thing and its opposite at the same time. Quantum logic says why not? Superposition of wavefunction forces us to abandon classical logic and adopt the new logic of quantum. So Schrödinger's cat can be dead and alive at the same time. The issue is not with nature, it’s with our application of the wrong logic to judge nature. 

&amp;#x200B;

Modal interpretations are partly based on these new quantum logical structures to quantum. In a sense, Bohmian mechanics can be seen as one of the modal interpretation. There’s many different ways to build a modal model of quantum. 

&amp;#x200B;

Given that maybe quantum is natural, might not the correct way to see quantum is to derive the axioms from information theoretic standpoint? 

&amp;#x200B;

Information Theoretical Reconstructions of Quantum Theory

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this paper\[[https://homepage.univie.ac.at/reinhold.bertlmann/pdfs/dipl\_diss/Horvath\_BA\_InformationTheoreticalReconstructionsOfQuantumTheory.pdf](https://homepage.univie.ac.at/reinhold.bertlmann/pdfs/dipl_diss/Horvath_BA_InformationTheoreticalReconstructionsOfQuantumTheory.pdf)\], the hope for approaching quantum is that by reconstruction quantum using more reasonable axioms, we can find the underlying physics of it much like special relativity had the tools of calculation before Einstein put in the physics for it. The paper includes efforts which reconstruct quantum such that the difference between classical and quantum is identified to be one axiom which allows a continuous change from one wavefunction to another, eg. For spin up and down in z-axis, one can rotate the wavefunction of the spin from spin up in z to pass by spin up in x-axis to become spin down in z-axis. This is the power of the qubit, as opposed to mere 0 and 1 for classical bits. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another formulation has even only 3 axioms to reconstruct quantum theory. They are: information capacity, locality and reversibility (continuity is in reversibility). So the basic idea is that there’s a finite amount of information that quantum systems can carry, so to ask it more questions such as asking for hidden variables, the system cannot give you, so it gives random results. Quantum theory is simply the theory of information nature has when you allow for continuous change of the state (wavefunction) of the system. They use QBism to interpret the measurement and probability and says otherwise, quantum needs no interpretation. It does take a lot of familiarity with information language to even get how is this interpretation natural. 

&amp;#x200B;

In essence, it has many of the same problems and features as Copenhagen. Schrödinger's cat it seems cannot be deemed as dead or alive due to limited information in the system, until you force a measurement on it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Quantum Bayesianism (QBism)

&amp;#x200B;

This shares almost the same properties with Copenhagen. The main difference is that quantum theory is all about the experimenter’s updating of their belief of what might happen. Measurement is part of the observer’s limb to measure to update their belief of what might happen. Wavefunction is merely a tool, to use to update beliefs according to well defined probability rules. The observer’s role is intrinsic in the interpretation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Since Schrödinger's cat’s superposition state is merely a calculation tool to update the experimenter’s belief, I don’t think QBism offers any insight into what happens to the cat, rather, it’s doing the experiment which the cat tells the experimenter how to update their belief that they can still find the cat being alive. 

&amp;#x200B;

Closely related is this other recent interpretation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Relational quantum mechanics

&amp;#x200B;

 The state (wavefunction) is the relation between the observer and the system. The physical content of the theory has not to do with objects themselves, but the relations between them. As Rovelli puts it:

&amp;#x200B;

""Quantum mechanics is a theory about the physical description of physical systems relative to other systems, and this is a complete description of the world.”

&amp;#x200B;

It shares the exact same properties with Qbism. Schrödinger's cat has many viewpoints according to this interpretation. To the cat, the poison system is collapsed and the cat knows if it is dead or alive. To us, before we open the box, the cat to us is still in the superposition state, only when we open the box can we share the same knowledge as the cat as to the state of aliveness it has. Different observers has their own version to describe quantum phenomenon as quantum physics is all about relations, not one viewpoint is the real viewpoint. 

&amp;#x200B;

Talking about relations, this next one involves shaking hands between the past and future!

&amp;#x200B;

Transactional interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

This involves taking the complex conjugate of the wavefunction into account as well. Normally, other interpretation only uses that part when calculating in accordance to Born’s rule to find the probabilities. This interpretation says that the complex conjugate of the wavefunction goes backwards in time from the future and the normal wavefunction goes forwards in time, the two meet and have a handshake of sorts, exchanging information until collapse of wavefunction happens. The receiver and emitter are the object observed and the observer, both are symmetric in emitting and receiving wavefunction. 

&amp;#x200B;

This whole process happens outside of the normal spacetime and wavefunctions are regarded as really existing. The collapse happens instantaneously to us as the process of handshake happens outside of spacetime. Schrödinger's cat was never in superposition, only in one state of another, regardless of whether the humans look at the cat. 

&amp;#x200B;

Close to this idea is another one which involves backwards signalling in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Time-symmetric theories

&amp;#x200B;

I guess this one takes the idea of backwards time signalling more seriously than Transactional interpretation. From wikipedia: Events in the future can affect ones in the past, exactly as events in the past can affect ones in the future. In these theories, a single measurement cannot fully determine the state of a system (making them a type of hidden-variables theory), but given two measurements performed at different times, it is possible to calculate the exact state of the system at all intermediate times. The collapse of the wavefunction is therefore not a physical change to the system, just a change in our knowledge of it due to the second measurement. Similarly, they explain entanglement as not being a true physical state but just an illusion created by ignoring retrocausality. The point where two particles appear to ""become entangled"" is simply a point where each particle is being influenced by events that occur to the other particle in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

What happens to Schrödinger's cat? First we measure the cat as we put the cat and radioactive device in the box, that’s the past boundary condition, then when we open the box, we have a future boundary condition. The claim of this interpretation is that we can trace what happens in between this past and future boundaries deterministically, no superposition is there. Of course, functionally, it doesn’t allow us to predict quantum results. 

&amp;#x200B;

Talking about time, there’s still one more interpretation without a unique history. 

&amp;#x200B;

Consistent Histories interpretation

&amp;#x200B;

This interpretation of quantum mechanics is based on a consistency criterion that then allows probabilities to be assigned to various alternative histories of a system such that the probabilities for each history obey the rules of classical probability while being consistent with the Schrödinger equation. In contrast to some interpretations of quantum mechanics, particularly the Copenhagen interpretation, the framework does not include ""wavefunction collapse"" as a relevant description of any physical process, and emphasizes that measurement theory is not a fundamental ingredient of quantum mechanics.

&amp;#x200B;

There can be many different histories, and quantum doesn’t tell us which ones happened. The inconsistent histories of measuring say spin in z-axis or spin in x-axis belongs to two different histories which are inconsistent with each other as one can only choose to measure one or another for these two doesn’t hold simultaneous values for spin in both directions at once. The measurement is used to select one of the consistent histories to talk about what happened. As long as we are careful to not mix up inconsistent histories as if they could happen in the same world, we are saved from the many paradoxes in Copenhagen. 

&amp;#x200B;

Schrödinger's cat being dead or alive belongs to two different histories, much like in many world’s case. 

&amp;#x200B;

Second to last is the infamous 

&amp;#x200B;

Superdeterminism 

&amp;#x200B;

We had seen before that this is the alternative if we don’t reject either locality or realism due to Bell’s inequality for the general case. Indeed, so far it seems that none of the interpretations we discussed have both locality and counterfactual definiteness. Some even discarded both. So if we want both of them, the only alternative left seems to be superdeterminism. The world is a conspiracy fixed right from the start to simulate the appearance of quantum world to humans. Since there is no freedom, thus no meaning to investigate this or that law as the conspiracy can go make us see any laws of nature that the conspiracy wishes. In retrospect, this seems to be giving up counterfactual definiteness as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, Schrödinger's cat doesn’t have any weird quantum superposition, but its fate was fixed and so is everyone’s else, including the decision to make the experiment or not. 

&amp;#x200B;

Suffice to say that hardly anyone takes this interpretation seriously. The price to pay, to accept fatalism is too high. 

&amp;#x200B;

And finally, the interpretation which I had been using from the start is called 

&amp;#x200B;

Instrumentalism

&amp;#x200B;

It’s not an official interpretation because rejects all interpretations and just focuses on the calculation. A shut up and calculate move. Functionally, it does uses many concepts from Copenhagen to give a sort of instinct on how quantum should behave like superposition etc. This stance can be seen as the atheist amongst the religions of interpretations. Schrödinger's cat as a thought experiment doesn’t matter until someone actually does the experiment.

The point is, the definition was picked because it lined up with what we wanted, but it's a completely arbitrary definition that we defined to make it fit the 24 hour, 60 minute system the world was familiar with.

Would it be reasonable to assume time may be a 4d sphere?,1604873144,"This thought came to me out of nowhere, but bear with me for a second. So I was thinking of a plane flying around the Earth. Because of time zones and stuff, you could theoretically end up at your destination earlier than you had left (when comparing the times for both locations.) However, this rarely happens because planes rarely fly faster than the rotation speed of the Earth (~1000 mph.) If you do manage to fly faster than 1000mph, you’d effectively be traveling in time if you base your time strictly off of the Sun’s location in the sky.

That’s not all. In thinking of this analogy, I was able to find a parallel to time dilation as well, if you base time strictly off of the Sun’s location in the sky. As you approach 1000 mph, the perceived day length would get longer and longer. If you fly at 90% of the speed of Earth’s rotation, the Earth would be rotating at 100 mph relative to you. That means your day length wouldn’t be 24 hours, but 240 hours.  Go just a little bit faster, up to 99% of the speed of rotation, and now the days are 2400 hours long. Essentially, when one (solar) day passes for you, a hundred days have passed for everyone else. As you keep getting closer to the Earth’s rotational speed, the day length would increase exponentially with respect to travel speed, to the point where a solar day for you would take millions of years. Sound familiar to a certain theory of relativity?

So here is what I thought- what if time was a higher dimensional sphere that was rotating at the speed of light? It behaves so similarly to a rotating sphere when you take into account the above observations. The only different is that instead of basing your observations on the solar day, you’re now truly traveling through time at much slower rate than others.

My thoughts are oriented towards large ""brush strokes"" rather than fine, minute detail, as I am not very well versed in the technicalities of physics, specifically, in thermodynamics and information theory.

As entropy increases in a given system, the number of possible microstates that exist for the particles in that system (which obviously, do not affect the system's overall macrostate) increases.

Thus, as entropy increases in a given system, the less information **we have** about the physical states of the constituent particles of that system.

However, as entropy increases in a given system, the more information **this system has**, as the total number of possible microstates for its constituent particles increases.

So here is the paradox: as entropy increases in a given system, the less information we have about that system, but the more information is contained within that system.

How to Calculate the Maximum Altitude of a Rocket with Instantaneous Sensor Data,1604781990,"Hi everyone, my apologies if this isn't the correct place to post this question (I'm very new to this sub). Beyond a very basic physics class I took in high school, I have very minimal background in physics; my background is primarily in Computer Science. I'm in college working on a project that will be integrated into a high-power rocket that's about 10 feet tall and 6 inches in diameter. One of the goals of this project is to use an altimeter and IMU, which will provide the following instantaneous data to a microcontroller: altitude, temperature, accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, Euler angle, quaternion, linear acceleration, and gravity (this is copy-pasted to what someone from the team told me, sorry if something is wrong). During the rocket's flight, the altimeter and IMU will be providing a continuous stream of data to the microcontroller, and the microcontroller needs to calculate what the projected maximum altitude of the rocket will be, every 1-2 seconds during flight. These predicted altitude values should be as close as possible to the actual maximum altitude, and we will be checking this after the flight, once all data has been logged. This needs to be programmed in Python, but not very many of us have the physics and math background to know how to do this and what calculations to make.

In other words, at a given point in time, if you're given the following information about a rocket: altitude, temperature, accelerometer, magnetometer, gyroscope, Euler angle, quaternion, linear acceleration, and gravity, how can you calculate the maximum altitude of the rocket?

Any and all help is appreciated regarding this. Thank you!",Physics,caract790,False,/r/Physics/comments/jpxz9t/how_to_calculate_the_maximum_altitude_of_a_rocket/

Why do EM shieldings need to be grounded?,1604775945,"EM shields like the net around a coaxial cable are always shorted to ground. The explanation for why this is necessary is that the currents induced by the EM noise have to go to ground to effectively stop them from reaching the inner conductor.

From a physics perspective though I don't understand why this should be necessary. In my (perhaps wrong) understanding of how EM shields work a wave arriving at the shield would induce a current, which by Lenz law would induce a counter-wave that decreases the magnitude of the EM field reaching the inner cable.

Mathematical Physics vs Theoretical Physics,1604765602,"So I just graduated with a bachelor degree in Physics and Mathematics. The goal has always been to become a theoretical physicist. However, I have always loved the rigor of pure mathematics. I need to pick between Physics or Mathematical Physics for my masters. Can someone help me out by pointing out the differences?  


From what I have already gathered, Mathematical Physics is different only with the rigor of math involved and Theoretical Physics employs Math with little regard for the rigor, often a very heuristic approach. Now I have seen this happen and I would be lying if I said it doesn't irk me when my professors say, "" yeah it doesn't matter (referring to my detailed math), just get to the answer. Of course, they are great physicists in their own right and I really have learnt much from them, but I simply get frustrated when things aren't completely addressed (i mean the how, why and all that with respect to the math used).  


 For more context, I enjoy some of the more mathematically involved parts of Physics(like qmech or stat mech).

An interesting similarity,1604756915," I've just found out an interesting relationship between electric and magnetic field through a dimensional analysis of their units of measurement

\[**E**\]=N/C=**N/(A**·**s)**

As you can see, the units of measurement of this two quantities only differ from each other for the time (**s**) in the electric and length (**m**) in the magnetic field.

Furthermore, some time ago, in an article on Wikipedia about electromagnetic potential, I read electric potential (which is scalar) is its **temporal** component, while magnetic potential (which is a vector field as well) is its **spatial** component.

My motivation to study physics,1604728810,"I'm 19 and in my 2nd undergraduate year of physics. And I kind of just want to share why I think it's such a great subject to study, even just to the B.A. level where it's still practically useless for the tech-related jobs I'm after. These are all just my own thoughts.

From a practical point of view, studying physics has seriously augmented my ability to creatively solve problems and leverage the niche properties and gimmicks in the back of the section of the textbook. And I guess this extends to math too but I basically see math and physics everywhere I look; I've always had a tendency to deconstruct things in my head -- if i look at a logo i'll be thinking of what shapes sequences of Illustrator commands led to that logo, and if i look at a bookshelf i try to imagine how the lumberjacks felled the tree and used different tools to cut it into the constituent pieces. I guess pulling together physics, math, and also graphic design which I dabble in help me really train my eye. In my opinion people who are well-trained mathematically have better vision than pilots in that regard, as they are readily able to deconstruct anything into models that are sturdily governed by logic and math properties. And that is the ultimate skill that I'm training toward, as I believe it is extremely valuable and something I already have a talent for.

From a philosophical point of view, physics has told me so far is that the world operates on a compact yet universal set of rules that can never be broken. There are problems you can't control in life, but that also means they won't be influenced by any of your actions, so you can rely on them to behave consistently so you can use them to your advantage. Just like physics problems and maybe in a sense the scientific method, your way out is to creatively combine the rules that don't break and discover new properties and rules that can be in your favor. And you also want to make sure that your own values are like these universal set of rules; as a person you want to stand for something you believe is right, and make no exceptions to uphold it, even with your life. I guess in that regard you can draw a connection between invariance -- one of the most fundamental concepts of physics -- and love, one of the most fascinating phenomena of humanity.

The way I see it, there is some truth to life that can be found through studying physics. I helps me augment my subconsciousness in a way I find meaningful and valuable.

Physics undergrad need every tip he can get,1604704237,"Hey, 
So I just startet my physics degree at university in germany and all I can say is that it is just so much harder then I expected it to be (just had my first week of lectures). The classes I have are Classic Theoretical Physics 1, Classic Experimental Physics 1 and Higher Mathematics 1 (I also have computer science as minor). 

So let me tell you what I‘m struggling with:

First all my classes are online for this semester which is the worst case scenario for me (I‘m a person who would need the pressure of going to uni every single day to kind of force me in a way). 

Now the thing is the Math at Uni is actually so much harder then I expected it to be...my professor explains everything at this insane pace and always comments on the topics like: „Well that‘s easy theres no need for explain“ or „as you can see already“ and I‘m always sitting there and not even getting the simple stuff it‘s just awful and really fucks up my confidence. I had nearly 2 mental breakdowns this week because of the sheets we have to turn and we have to get a 50% percentage in average per sheet in the whole semester so I should really aim for 90%-100% in those first sheets...but I dont think I will

It‘s mostly maths for me, I constantly have that feeling that I have issues of logical understanding and once I don‘t get a thing my brain is out for the rest of the lecture...

And thats just Maths!!!

Then theres Theo and Exp also it is so much more information in such a short time period compared to school (I knew it will be faster but didnt expect this) 

And then I really didnt have a single minute for computer science this week just sat in the lectures (online) and didn‘t even try to follow through because I knew it‘s just too much (Had all those math stuff in my brain..)

Now the thing is I could do the exercises in my physics classes (mostly) but I just took too long. 

Time flies by so fast every single day it‘s like I‘m stuck at ab exercise and boom 3 hours GONE 

Now I desperately need some help, mostly tips or reassurance that this is „normal“ at the beginning (or is it not?).

My passion for the universe and the unknown is the only thing that keeps me going. That little smile when I complete an exercise look over my sheet and think yea man look at this, I DID THIS but then again this is just basic stuff, easy stuff and it seems so hard for me I just feel like I‘m taking too long to get everything. 

I would be grateful for any advise I can get. I want to do this! I don‘t wanna be a drop out because there is this feeling inside me that says you can do it and that‘s what I wanna do. I have passion and will but how far will it get me.

Also any recommendations for books? I just bought the feynman lectures as they seemed to be really popular and good in reputation but I think Math books that teach the formal stuff of Uni would much much more helpful at the start.

Need Help with Clarification on Fluid Flow in Space,1604507713,"Hello everyone,

I am in the field of psychology/neuroscience but have a physics related problem that I am sure some of you can help with clarification. I was writing a literature review on the neurophysiological changes in space when I started to notice the similarities of problems across all systems of the bodies, not just the brain.  Spaceflight symptoms, which are extensive, seem to stem from a dysfunction in the distribution of fluid in the body. Cerebrospinal fluid redistribution, cardiovascular flow, interstitial fluid, and the genitourinal system show inhibited function which leads to concerning symptoms for astronauts.

My question -- It is no secret that these fluids in the body follow the laws of physics and fluid mechanics, but how do the equations for bodily flow exist in a zero gravity environment? When looking at the equations for different flow of systems (Pressure gradients, Bernoulli's equation, Pulsatile flow, Hemodynamics, etc.) they all have gravity tied in the equation or it is assumed. How would plugging a zero for gravitational force not collapse these equations and utterly stop function of body systems? My theory was that while the astronauts are falling along geodesic orbits they still feel 90% of Earth's gravity, in which bodily fluid can still access Earth's gravitation force. But after a quick conversation with another colleague I was told that the fluids in our body are in fact in free fall as well. Can anyone expand on how bodily fluid flow is possible in a zero gravity environment?",Physics,sgm_,False,/r/Physics/comments/jnzum9/need_help_with_clarification_on_fluid_flow_in/
A question about some basic dynamics,1604506888,"This isn't some homework, I just saw this while practicing physics for my college entrance exam twice and saw different solutions in both cases.

&amp;#x200B;

The question is pretty simple: You have the classic block on a ramp. The block has a mass of m and the ramp has a mass of M, the coefficient of friction between the ramp and the block is  *γ*  and there is no friction between the ramp and the ground. The ramp has an angle of incline of  α . What's the ramp's velocity going to be when the block reaches the ground if we let it slide down the ramp from a height of h? (translated the problem so please don't mind it if it doesn't sound nice).

&amp;#x200B;

There were some differences between the two scenarios, but the biggest one was that one solution added a force of inertia to the block in the direction the block is moving in, while the other one added a force of acceleration to the block in the direction the ramp is moving in.

This is how I realized the universe works. Its incredibly mindblowing and theres a part of me that hopes im wrong, because I feel like I spoiled all the mistery by questioning too much, and now I face an existential crisis.

Each one of us lives in an universe of their own. In our own universe, we have free will. In other people's universe, we are an undetermined set of probabilities. Each of our actions has a different probability of occuring, based on the actions we take on our own individual universes. 

What defines an universe? Consciousness. If you feel aware of your own existence, you're in your universe. However, it may seem like other people are conscious, they do have minds, but having a mind is different of having consciousness. The universe is made of information and you, the user, are decoding it. 

Our universes then intersect. When you die, your consciousness is transfered to another person's universe. 

There is a reason why we are here, and there is a reason why you're in one universe or another. Your job is to find and understand that reason, so that the source of consciousness can evolve, in some way. I believe that reason has to do with the source understanding itself. The source is, fundamentally, paradoxical, in manyndifferent ways. It is love, but love only has meaning when we find that meaning. Every person has a different view on what love is, and so, thats why we are here, so that the source can understand what it is.

decays into calcium and argon at a steady rate such that half the potassium

How could I go about visualizing the change in air composition (O2 vs CO2) over time for a “person in a sealed room” scenario?,1604435918,"Let me begin by saying that I’m not particularly educated in physics - but I did make a genuine effort to find the answer myself. I was a bit surprised that I didn’t find anything conclusive. Maybe I’m missing something obvious, since this seems like it would be a common curiosity. Most commonly asked, however, is “how long would one survive”, rather than “how would the air composition change”.

That being said: This is NOT a question about survival. So please ignore the food, water and other aspects. This is only about the air composition.

Anyways, we can safely assume the following:

1.) Starting with common outdoor air composition (~78% nitrogen, ~21% oxygen, ~1% CO2 and others). We can consider the starting ratio of O2:CO2 to be rounded to 21:1
2.) Completely sealed, airtight room
3.) Average *resting* adult oxygen usage, only one person in the room
4.) No ventilation and no air scrubbers
5.) No other variables affecting air composition
6.) Example room size: 500 cubic ft (~28.3 cubic meters)

In theory this is impossible, however hypothetical would it be true? 

If I’m standing still and a person is running around in a circle next to me equal to the speed of light for 1 minute, when that person stops would he meet past me or present me? Because as I understand, if you move at the speed of light then time will stop for you. 

So if you ran at 12:00 AM for 1 minute then after you stop would time still be 12:00 AM? Or will everything around you move faster and become 12:01 AM?

Where am I wrong?,1604411294,"Sorry for the question, I'm a physics noob. This question is related to the [last Veritasium video about one way speed of light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k). No TL;DR sorry.

I was thinking about this:

**Experiment #1:**

Get 3 clocks in the same position and start them at the same instant. All clocks are placed at the center of the same perfectly straight rail. One clock stays still in the center the other two move at the edges of the rail.

Reduce the [moving clock ticks slower effect](https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k?t=160) by moving the 2 clocks away from the center at some absurdly slow speed, like it takes them 1 year (or more) to both reach the same position (so whatever ""slowing"" they had experienced is nothing compared to the magnitude of the speed of light). Fire beam of light to both clocks.

Imagine that (overly simplified) for every meter of movement the clock experience a slowing proportional to its ***velocity \**** ***distortion***, whatever ***distortion*** value is (or even a function to something else) if ***velocity*** is extremely slow the error given by ***distortion*** may be ignored.

By looking at just one clock on one edge, if we managed to move it slow enough, the time ""slowing"" experienced is so minimal that the measure is accurate enough for our goal.

The other clock serves the purpose to detect if light travels at the same speed on the other direction.

**Experiment #2:**

Do #1 multiple times with bigger scale and/or moving the clocks slower to the edge (1 year, 2, 5, 10...). Wait for all experiment to finish. See if results are consistent, see if accuracy improves.... Also when waiting for 10 year to pass you could do 1 year experiment 10 times. This may also be the key to make everything faster by choosing a smaller time frame for the slowest experiment of all (6 month as example) and iterating multiple faster experiments in the mean time, collect everything at the end and get a nice avg (overly simplified).

**Experiment #3:**

Instead of a single rail, create a sphere (a really big one) with a rail for each dimension, angle bisector between dimension, etc... (basically create a globe, draw longitude and latitude lines, put a rail that goes straight from one side to the other every time a longitude line intersect a latitude line) .... Do the experiment again but this time you have multiple rails.

This experiment would test if speed of light change in a specific direction/dimension. We might have been lucky with the single rail experiment and just got the rail perfectly perpendicular to the direction where the speed of light changes.

Also if we actually see that the speed of light changes in one dimension even slightly, do this means that there is an ""up"" and ""down"" in the universe? Like I could say that the direction where the speed of light is bigger is the ""up"" of the universe.

**Experiment #4:**

Do #2 applied to #3 but also do it in different place since it could be that no only the speed of light changes based on direction/dimension but, the change itself is not constant on all the universe. This may be impossible to do on earth since, probably, to detect a change on how the speed of light change (sorry for the tongue twister) we might have to do our experiments placed at solar system distance or more.",Physics,Mariomariamario,False,/r/Physics/comments/jnaje9/where_am_i_wrong/

"If length contraction can occur, why can't length expansion?",1604361410,"My understanding of length contraction is that it occurs due to there being a delay (t) between when an observer sees one point (x1) on an object and another point (x2), as there is a longer distance for light to travel. Point x1 will travel distance vt before point x2 is seen, so, to the observer, point x1 will be closer to point x2, therefore the object appears shorter; it has contracted.

But it seems that it's accepted that length contraction will occur regardless of whether the object is moving towards or away from the observer - this doesn't make sense to me. If the scenario I mentioned above was replicated, except the object traveled at -v, (towards the observer, rather than away from it) x1 would - to the observer - be further away from x2, meaning it would have expanded. 

I have gone over this many times and I cannot spot a flaw in my logic, yet I am still unsure of myself, as I believe what I'm proposing goes against the accepted 'truths' of physics.

Why does power required increase as a force accelerates a body?,1604252071,"If a constant force is being applied to a body, without any other external forces, F = ma says that that body will accelerate at a constant rate. This acceleration will continuously increase the body's velocity.

Testing Einstein's conjecture - that the speed of light is constant in all directions.,1604244401,"This video got me to thinking - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTn6Ewhb27k)

In it they point out that no one has measured the one way speed of light, only the two way speed. By the end of the video I was thinking on how to test this, and this morning I woke up with an idea of how.

I fully expect Einstein's conjecture - that c is constant in all directions - will be proven.

The test is to set up at least three emitter/sensor arrays that are equidistant from each other. They don't even need to try to time the light (avoiding the moving clocks go slower problem).  Each array has a laser aimed at the others equidistant from them and sensors to receive the lasers aimed at them. When they detect a light ping they send out light beams to the equidistant points.

If the speed of light is constant in all directions (as we've always assumed but never conclusively proven) then each point will always receive light pings from the others simultaneously.

Also, this test should work an arbitrary number of equidistant points and in 3d space as well.  The only constraint is that all the points are equidistant and not moving relative to each other.

Is it even conceptionally possible to break this?  For example, consider the vertices of an equilateral triangle.  There exists 3 sides, therefore 6 one way paths between the three points.  Is there a set of values other than having c be equal for all six rays that will keep the each point receiving in sync?  I don't think so, and even if one were found wouldn't that break the moment the orientation of the three break?

And it gets more fun with a tetrahedron (a 4 sided die configuration).  Say we rig up our vertices to emit a flash whenever they receive light from the other three. We kick things off by having one vertice only flash and if Einstein's conjecture is true all will see the other three flash together in a regular rhythm. If the conjecture isn't true this rhythm will never form. 

It shouldn't be that hard to build this test though.",Physics,Odysseus_Cipher,False,/r/Physics/comments/jm40zh/testing_einsteins_conjecture_that_the_speed_of/

I see some innate symmetries to the world within data. Not just the world, but us humans as well. Take for example the [Gaussian distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).

Interesting that information's fastest speed, is the speed of light, and also gravity's fastest speed, is the speed of light.

Is gravity somehow related to the ability for one mass to 'know' the precise location of other mass? Does this 'know-ability' somehow draw objects together to preserve entropy? After all, isolation using temperature (reducing entropy) is how a [Bose–Einstein condensate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate) is created.

I think I may have found a way to find if light is really constant at both direction.( I would recommend you to watch latest Veritasium video on the speed of light for context if there is some problem understanding me),1604159828,"Let's suppose light is not constant at both direction and let's do the same experiment to find the speed of light but with a little change to it.  Let's take two mirrors at a distance of *d* and shoot light from the side of one mirror to the other and let's say the time taken to reach the mirror to the other side is t1 but before the light could reflect back to the our mirror let's push our mirror *x* meter ahead and let's say it takes t2 time to reach us from the the other mirror . And let's give name to the velocities V1(From the side we shoot our  photon or light) and v2(from the other side). So the total time that will be taken would be *d/v1 + (d-x)/v2* Now here is the fun part. So if light is really constant at both direction then the time taken will be *d/c + (d-x)/c* (here c is the speed of light that we use)  so if after the experiment the time doesn't match according to this formula : *d/c + (d-x)/c* that would mean the speed of light would be following this formula : *d/v1 + (d-x)/v2*  and thus  we proved that the speed of light isn't constant at both direction.

Question about measuring the speed of light,1604149639,"I watched the [most recent veritasium video](https://youtu.be/pTn6Ewhb27k), where he talks about why no one has measured the exact speed of light.

Essentially, his point is that we’ve only been able to measure the two way speed of light, and not the one way, which may be the true speed of light. It’s a really interesting video I recommend everyone here to watch  it if it sounds intriguing to you. 

He proposes an experiment where we have two timers, sync them together, and move one timer 1 km away, and shine a laser through both, and have the first timer stop when the laser passes through it, and the second timer stop when the laser passes through it. 

This gives us the speed of light in the distance of 1km in the time of the difference between two timers on both ends of that 1km. BUT, he points out a flaw in the experiment, that due to einstein’s theory of relativity, the timer moving away slows down. 

But what if we put them both at the middle of the 1km distance, sync them while they’re beside eachother, move one 500m left, and the other 500m right? Would the slowing down on both cancel eachother out, and then we would have an accurate time?",Physics,_jAYsown_,False,/r/Physics/comments/jli2fs/question_about_measuring_the_speed_of_light/

Integrity and public outreach mutually exclusive?,1604126942,"My today's dedication to procrastination lead me to an article in Discover (a magazine reporting ""captivating developments in science, medicine, technology, and the world around us"")

(The Quantum Internet Will Blow Your Mind. Here’s What It Will Look Like)[https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/the-quantum-internet-will-blow-your-mind-heres-what-it-will-look-like]

with the abstract

""The next generation of the Internet will rely on revolutionary new tech — allowing for unhackable networks and information that travels faster than the speed of light.""

Information traveling faster than the speed of light is a red flag. This is not necessarily wrong as ""information traveling"" can mean a lot of things. Superluminal communications are impossible but there are other variants. For instance, delayed-choice scenarios may even be interpreted as information propagating back in time, so there's a bit of artistic license here.

The body of the article, however, follows up. The article is written after interviewing Prof. Figueroa, ""one of the world’s pioneering gardeners planting the seeds of a quantum internet"", from SUNY at Stony Brook. There's a short [clip on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o7IqkKlcGN0) with the lab visit, there were also conversations over the phone. So, all that compelled the journalist to conclude the first paragraph by 

&gt; Capable of sending enormous amounts of data over vast distances, it [the quantum internet] would work not just faster than the current internet but faster than the speed of light — instantaneously, in fact, like the teleportation of Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk in Star Trek.

By comparing with the internet, the terms get defined, and we can with certainty say that this is impossible. 

So, what are they doing at Stony Brook? Technically, they implement memory-assisted entanglement swapping. Entanglement swapping is a particular case of a general class of phenomena, which can be called quantum teleportation. I don't like this term as nothing is teleporting there, but this is the vocabulary.

QT, in turn, is a consequence of the collapse of entangled states. Say, we have an entangled state, measure its part, and obtain some outcome. This leads to the collapse of the rest of the system to an outcome dependent state. 

The structure of the collapsed states is not arbitrary. There are two characteristic orthonormal sets of states at play. The eigenstates of the observable, and the eigenvectors of the (reduced) density matrix of the measured part. These sets of states are related by a unitary transformation, which we call aligning. The set of the collapsed states is a (distorted) image of the mixed eigenstates under the action of the transposed (or complex conjugated, depending on the definition) aligning transformation. The distortion depends on the structure of the original entangled state, the Hilbert spaces, and so on. If the spaces are the same and the state is fully entangled, the distortion is again unitary and does not depend on the measurement outcome.

Thus, we can say that, in a sense, the collapse transfers the aligning transformation to the rest of the system. This is the precursor of QT.

For qubits, this simplifies because of the smallness of the Hilbert spaces. Now, there are outcome dependent correcting transformations turning the rest of the system to the result of the action of the transposed aligning transformation on an eigenvector of the reduced density matrix. Importantly, the correcting transformations do not depend on the aligning transformation and, thus, we can transfer any unknown transformation. This already could be called QT.

The choice of correcting transformations crucially depends on the measurement outcome. Without knowing it, the collapsed state cannot be distinguished from the original (no-communication theorem). Thus, if different parties control different parts of the composed system, the outcome must be communicated by conventional means.

The canonical QT is obtained when one part is not affected by an aligning transformation but, instead, is entangled with an unknown state. Here as well, the correcting transformations depend on the measurement outcome, which must be communicated conventionally to complete the transfer of the unknown state.

The entanglement swapping is a transfer of an entangled state to a disentangled pair of qubits. Again, this requires sending the measurement outcome.

This is well known for a while: if we want to use quantum channels to send arbitrary quantum states (say, within a quantum information processing infrastructure, or to establish secure communications), we must have supplementary classical channels. If we don't want that, we need to grossly restrict the set of transmitted states and then the quantum channel cannot outperform a classical one (the Holevo bound) and is as exposed as classical. Unless the quantum internet is embedded into a quantum ecosystem (which is not impossible, of course), it is as productive as sending a flash-drive by mail and then in Zoom compare individual bytes.

Now, the question: how this got published?

A. It is possible that the journalist didn't get a thing, didn't look for explanations elsewhere, and didn't run his write up through Prof. Figueroa. Usually, this is not how it's done but that's not impossible. In this case, the journalist has plainly damaged the reputation.

B. It is possible that Prof. Figueroa is more fluent in quantum optical experimentation techniques than in theoretical quantum mechanics, and his students have a scaled-down portion of his area of expertise. Judging by the text, however, the journalist apparently asked for an opinion of Mikhail Lukin, ""a leading quantum theoretician and experimentalist at Harvard University"". Prof. Lukin responded

&gt; The idea [the entanglement swapping] has by now been around for 20 years. Up to now, no one has succeeded in building one capable of being used in a practical application. As far as I understand, that’s what [Figueroa]’s group is trying to do.

Again, it is possible that the journalist took Prof. Lukin's words out of the context, or just invented them. So, we back to bad journalism and damaged reputations.

There are, however, also C, D ... ""There's no such thing as bad publicity"", students vigorously respecting the chain of command or simply fearing conflicts and other consequences, neglected integrity in favor of not spoiling the image of a fellow scientist and of a field of study, ""it's good for funding"", ""how else can we make it exciting"".

Frankly, I don't know what it is in this case. Is this how things are now? What is going on?",Physics,haharisma,False,/r/Physics/comments/jldvuv/integrity_and_public_outreach_mutually_exclusive/
To a rigorous physicist who understands climate science in detail,1604123523,"Preamble: it’s in our best interest to act in ways that are probable especially if the down sides of an action are not extreme. Therefore I am in favor of being environmentally friendly if it’s probable global warming exists. Also, I’m not trying to muddy the water here with semantics, like 99% instead of 100%

However, this is a question to a physicist who understand rainfall/weather patterns etc can we say with a great deal of probability that these models are correct. I mean the potential margins of error on rainfall quantities that can occur in a geographical area can be very large. I think I understand Dyson objections to calling global warming a fact based on climate modeling. If you watch  Dyson’s interviews you may come across one when he talks about when he went to Cornell, the first project he worked there  had produced experimentally viable result which he took to Enrico Fermi at Chicago. Fermi immediately showed him the error. The issue was that of the controlled variables(and having too many of them). The result allowed the Cornell team to inadvertently doctor their own results and prove the existence of something that is not there. From here Dyson, I assume gains a great distrust of models that too many variables that are questionable. 

So I can only assume that climate models in his mind have the same type of problems.

My question isn't about the difference between these units, I understand that. The thing I am confused about is that in Europe they measure bodyweight in Kilograms, a unit of mass. And in the US we measure our weight in pounds, a unit of force. To be consistent wouldn't it make more sense if we measured our weight in slugs in the US, or alternatively if Europeans measured they weight in Newtons instead of Kilograms. In the US we measure body weight as a force (mass \* gravity), where as in Europe they just measure mass (which probably makes more sense because gravity isn't the same everywhere). So that's my point. Why don't we use slugs in the US instead of pounds to measure bodyweight? I just find it kind of annoying that it isn't consistent. If we insist of using different units at least make it consistent. We should either use slugs and kg, or lbs and newtons, for the US and Europe respectively.

The scenario that I'm trying to solve is whether or not it requires more work for a bike to be front loaded or rear loaded. In physics we are taught to believe that pushing an object requires more work due to the fact that the force being applied is acting downwards on the object being pushed. Pulling an object however adds lift to the object, therefore the work required is less.

Michio Kaku: Why Physics Ends the Free Will Debate | Big Think,1604031613,"Here is the [video](https://youtu.be/Jint5kjoy6I)

Michio Kaku claims that we have some sort of Free Will due to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle which has been scientifically proved, so I guess that would void Newtonian Determinism then wouldn't it? No particle has a pre-determined location or any characteristic so that means we aren't certain of it unless we measure it be it an electron or a subatomic particle of some sort. Would this hint at some form of compatibilism since we have some indeterminate ""free will"".

I found this comment on the video ""Well.. I wouldn't call the randomness in quantum mechanics, our free will, since we do not determine the outcome of the random process."" -torkamarinum

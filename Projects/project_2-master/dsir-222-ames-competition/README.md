### Overview

In this project, I will use the Ames housing data to create a multiple linear regression model that predicts the price of houses in Ames, IA.

### Problem Statement

Find out the the features which can help to make prediction


---

### Datasets

* [`train.csv`](train.csv): training data set: 81 columns
* [`test.csv`](test.csv): testing data set: 8 columns, saleprice missing


---

### EDA & Visulization

This data contains a lot of categorical columns, in order to better understand the info behind the features, I 'walk' thought each one of the features.
For categorical variables, there are 3 things I need to check:
* Plot the boxplots of each category's sale_price, check if there significant evidence shows the correlation
* Check the frequency of the category
* Check missing values

After all, I found some features that are highly correlated to sale_price, I also found some feature might have correlation as well but some transfromation of engineering needed



### Feature Engineering


### Model

Ridge

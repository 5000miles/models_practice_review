### Overview

The SAT standardized test that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). :
* [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat)

### Problem Statement

I want to figure out if there is any relationship between income and SAT scores?

### Data

There are 10 datasets included in the [`data`](./data/) folder for this project. You are required to pick **at least two** of these to complete your analysis. Feel free to use more than two if you would like, or add other relevant datasets you find online.

* [`sat_2019_ca.csv`](./data/sat_2019_ca.csv): 2019 SAT Scores in California by School

Students who lived high income areas tend to have higher SAT scores. But more data need to prove.

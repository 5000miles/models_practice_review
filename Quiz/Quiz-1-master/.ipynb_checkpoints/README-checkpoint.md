## Instructions
The notebook in this repository contains 5 coding challenges. You are to clone this repository and fill in the quiz with your answers, taking special care to follow the directions _exactly_. In many questions, we ask that you name variables in a specific way. Make sure to do this, as we use it for grading.

To **submit** your quiz, drop your completed notebook in the file uploader in the provided Google Form.

## Quiz Information
- This is an "open book" quiz - you may use any resources! This includes Jupyter notebooks, Google, StackOverflow, and your notes. ANY RESOURCE YOU USE MUST BE CITED (comment your code with links, which lesson you got the inspiration from, etc.) and failure to cite resources you use will be considered plagiarism. 
- You may NOT work with anyone else on this quiz (your classmates, your instructor, etc.).
- You will have 45 minutes to take this quiz.
- Do your best and good luck!

## Learning Targets Assessed
You should be able to:
- Successfully create and invoke a function
- Return a value from a function
- Apply a probability rule
- Filter lists and dictionaries

## Motivation
In many data science interviews, you will be required to complete a technical test or take-home assignment. These are often in the form of a coding challenge or a task given for you to complete within a certain amount of time. These quizzes are designed to emulate that process to prepare you to be successful during the interview process.

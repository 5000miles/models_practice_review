# Description
Real data is messy, even when it's clean! In this lab, you'll use all of your Python and Pandas skills to transform a poorly organized set of Excel files into a format conducive to data science. This task may seem mundane, but it is realistic to many tasks data scientists encounter. Most of our time is spent reading, cleaning, and moving data.

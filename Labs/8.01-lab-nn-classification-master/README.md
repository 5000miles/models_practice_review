In this lab, you will be creating a neural net model for a binary classification problem based on UCI's heart disease dataset (Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease). You will be trying to predict a target variable which indicates whether the patient had heart disease or not.

## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |

## Tips
We highly recommend running this in Colab. Go File->Upload notebook to upload this notebook to colab. You can import data and run your cells as normal, then simply download the ipynb file and transfer it to your submissions. All outputs will be preserved. When in Colab, we also recommend switching your runtime to TPU, which may require re-installing some libraries.

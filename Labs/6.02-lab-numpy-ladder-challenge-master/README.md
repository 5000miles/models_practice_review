# Climb the Ladder!
Our class moves quickly! Sometimes, it feels like we make leaps in logic that are a bit too big. In this ladder challenge, we'll learn some core math concepts, some linear algebra, and the `numpy` library. Problems in this notebook start out easy and progressively get harder, so that the next rung of the Python ladder is always within reach.

Additionally, since not all of the topics discussed in this ladder challenge are explicitly taught in our course, these problems come with many more hints, tips, suggestions, and even sometimes a mini-lesson. You are encouraged to Google frequently throughout the lesson. In many ways, this ladder is meant to be a challenge as well as educational in its own right.

## Contents
This repository contains three notebooks, separated only so they do not get too long. The content is divided into 5 sections and are designed to be completed in order. Do not skip!

| File | Section | Contents |
| ---: | :---: | :--- |
| 1 | I | Vectors and some vector math |
| 1 | II | Statistics and vector operations |
| 2 | III | Simulation |
| 2 | IV | Matrices |
| 3 | V | All the Matrix Algebra in the World |

## Solutions?
Solutions will _never_ be uploaded here. Your instructor may give you solutions at their own discretion. We encourage the use of Googling to aid you in solving these problems\*! That's how the pros do it!

\* That is, Googling _how_ to solve a problem. Not Googling solutions to problems.
